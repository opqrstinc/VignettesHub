# VignettesHub (AI-Generated Case Collection)

## Overview
VignettesHub is a project developed by OPQRST Inc. that generates simulated medical cases using AI. By providing classic examples of diseases, it helps users understand the symptoms, tests, treatments, and clinical courses of rare conditions. Physician-edited versions of the AI-generated cases are also being created. These resources are available for self-study, education, and research. Currently, case generation is being expanded to languages other than Japanese.

## Features
- **Multilingual support**: Cases are available in languages beyond Japanese
- **AI-generated content**: Created using various models provided by OpenAI, based on custom prompts
- **Expert supervision**: Physician-reviewed and edited cases (in progress)
- **Educational use**: Designed for self-learning and classroom use

## How to Use
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Navigate to the folder corresponding to your desired language and disease.
3. View or download the case files for use.
