"A 61-year-old male with a history of hypertension presented with intermittent chest pain, shortness of breath, and palpitations that had progressively worsened over the past two weeks. The chest discomfort was characterized as a diffuse, pressure-like sensation located in the mid-sternum. It was exacerbated by physical exertion, such as climbing stairs, and relieved partially with rest. He described occasional radiation of the pain to his left arm and jaw. The symptoms initially lasted only a few minutes but had recently begun occurring more frequently, including at rest, and were associated with increasing episodes of dyspnea.
On physical examination, the blood pressure was 150/95 mmHg, the heart rate was 92 bpm, and he was afebrile. Cardiovascular auscultation revealed a normal S1 and S2 without murmurs, rubs, or gallops. The lungs were clear bilaterally, and there were no signs of jugular venous distension or peripheral edema. The abdominal and neurological examinations were unremarkable.
An ECG demonstrated ST-segment depression of 1-2 mm in the anterolateral leads without T-wave inversions. Serial troponin I levels were within normal limits, excluding acute myocardial infarction. A chest X-ray showed no significant abnormalities. Further assessment with treadmill stress testing was discontinued due to the onset of chest pain and a drop in blood pressure. Myocardial perfusion imaging revealed a reversible perfusion defect in the left anterior descending coronary artery territory, supporting the diagnosis of unstable angina.
The patient was admitted to the coronary care unit with a diagnosis of unstable angina. Initial treatment included oxygen supplementation via nasal cannula at 2 L/min and administration of aspirin at 325 mg orally, followed by 81 mg daily. Clopidogrel was started with a loading dose of 300 mg, followed by 75 mg daily. Subcutaneous enoxaparin at 1 mg/kg every 12 hours was initiated for anticoagulation. Nitroglycerin infusion was titrated starting at 5 mcg/min and was increased to alleviate chest pain, along with oral metoprolol at 50 mg twice daily for heart rate and blood pressure control. Atorvastatin 40 mg daily was administered for lipid management.
Following stabilization, coronary angiography identified a 90% stenosis in the proximal LAD. Percutaneous coronary intervention with drug-eluting stent placement was performed without complications. Dual antiplatelet therapy was continued with aspirin and clopidogrel. The nitroglycerin infusion was transitioned to oral isosorbide mononitrate 30 mg daily upon resolution of symptoms. The patient was discharged three days later with instructions for cardiac rehabilitation and follow-up. He remained symptom-free at one-month follow-up."
