"A 60-year-old male presented with a 12-hour history of severe, intermittent right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain radiating to the right shoulder, accompanied by nausea and a single episode of vomiting. He reported that the pain began suddenly after a large, fatty meal and progressively worsened. He also noted subjective fever and chills but denied any chest pain, shortness of breath, or changes in bowel habits. His medical history was significant for a previous episode of cholecystitis treated conservatively five years prior. He denied alcohol or drug use and had no family history of gallbladder disease.
On physical examination, he was febrile with a temperature of 38.4°C, his HR was 105 bpm, and BP was 132/84 mmHg. He exhibited RUQ tenderness with a positive Murphy's sign. Mild scleral icterus was noted, but no other signs of jaundice were evident. The abdomen was soft overall, without rebound tenderness or peritoneal signs. His respiratory and cardiovascular exams were unremarkable. Peripheral pulses were intact, and the extremities showed no signs of edema or cyanosis.
Laboratory results revealed leukocytosis with a WBC count of 15,200/μL and an elevated CRP at 6.2 mg/dL. LFTs showed elevated ALT at 92 U/L, AST at 86 U/L, ALP at 175 U/L, and total bilirubin of 2.3 mg/dL. Serum lipase and amylase levels were within normal limits. An abdominal US demonstrated multiple gallstones within the gallbladder, acoustic shadowing, and gallbladder wall thickening (5 mm), consistent with cholelithiasis and cholecystitis. The common bile duct (CBD) was mildly dilated at 7 mm, raising suspicion for choledocholithiasis. MRCP confirmed the presence of a stone within the distal CBD measuring 6 mm, with no evidence of bile duct stricture or mass.
The patient was diagnosed with acute calculous cholecystitis complicated by choledocholithiasis. He was initially treated with intravenous hydration, bowel rest, and antibiotics. Piperacillin-tazobactam (3.375 g every 6 hours IV) was started to cover biliary pathogens. Pain was managed with IV ketorolac (30 mg every 6 hours as needed) and acetaminophen (650 mg orally every 6 hours). ERCP was performed within 24 hours of admission, successfully extracting the CBD stone. Post-ERCP cholangiography confirmed the absence of residual stones or obstruction. Following ERCP, his symptoms of RUQ pain, nausea, and vomiting resolved.
The patient underwent an elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy two days later to prevent future episodes of cholecystitis and stone formation. Pathologic examination of the gallbladder revealed evidence of chronic inflammation without evidence of malignancy. Postoperative recovery was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 2 with a 7-day course of oral ciprofloxacin (500 mg twice daily) and metronidazole (500 mg three times daily) for antimicrobial coverage. At a 2-week follow-up visit, he remained asymptomatic with no recurrence of pain, fever, or other complications."
