"A 24-year-old female presented with right lower abdominal pain and fever that began 24 hours prior to admission. The pain initially started in the periumbilical region, was described as dull, and later migrated to the right lower quadrant (RLQ) over several hours, becoming sharper and more localized. She reported associated nausea and anorexia, but no vomiting or changes in bowel habits. She denied urinary symptoms such as dysuria or frequency. She had no history of similar symptoms. Her past medical history included allergic rhinitis, with no prior surgical history. She was not taking any routine medications and denied substance use or smoking.
On physical examination, her temperature was 38.3°C, HR was 102 bpm, BP was 118/72 mmHg, and RR was 16 breaths/min. A physical exam revealed RLQ tenderness with guarding and rebound tenderness. The Rovsing’s sign and psoas sign were positive, while the obturator sign was negative. No abnormal findings were identified on cardiovascular, respiratory, or neurological exams. Her abdomen was soft, with normal bowel sounds. No palpable masses or hepatosplenomegaly were noted.
Laboratory results revealed leukocytosis with a WBC count of 14,500/µL with a left shift (neutrophil predominance). CRP was elevated at 6.2 mg/dL, and her hemoglobin and platelet counts were within normal ranges. Serum electrolytes, renal function, and liver enzymes were normal. Urinalysis was unremarkable, with no evidence of pyuria or hematuria. A beta-hCG test was negative. Abdominal US showed a non-compressible, blind-ended tubular structure measuring approximately 8 mm in diameter in the RLQ with periappendiceal fat stranding. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis confirmed these findings, showing an inflamed appendix with surrounding fat stranding. No abscess or perforation was identified.
The patient was diagnosed with acute uncomplicated appendicitis based on the clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and imaging results.
She was started on IV fluids and empirical antibiotics consisting of ceftriaxone (2 g once daily) and metronidazole (500 mg every 8 hours) preoperatively. She underwent a laparoscopic appendectomy the following day. Intraoperative findings included an inflamed, non-perforated appendix without any visible complications. The surgical procedure was uneventful, and the appendix was successfully removed. Postoperatively, the patient was continued on the same antibiotic regimen for 24 hours and then transitioned to oral antibiotics, specifically amoxicillin-clavulanate (875 mg/125 mg twice daily) for a total of 5 days. Pain management was achieved with oral acetaminophen (500 mg every 6 hours as needed).
Her recovery was smooth, with resolution of fever and pain within 48 hours. She was discharged home on postoperative day 2 in stable condition. At her follow-up visit one week later, she reported no recurrence of symptoms, her surgical wounds were healing appropriately, and she was advised to gradually resume normal activities."
