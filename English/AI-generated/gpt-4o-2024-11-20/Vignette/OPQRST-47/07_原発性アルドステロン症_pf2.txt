"A 22-year-old female presented with a history of newly diagnosed hypertension and occasional palpitations. She had been experiencing these symptoms for approximately six months prior to her visit. The patient reported intermittent episodes of muscle weakness and fatigue without specific triggers. These symptoms were accompanied by a sense of restlessness but no chest pain, dyspnea, or significant weight changes. She had a past medical history of dyslipidemia diagnosed two years prior, for which she had been prescribed atorvastatin, but she had discontinued the medication on her own due to perceived side effects. There was no family history of hypertension or cardiovascular disease. Social history revealed no smoking, alcohol, or recreational drug use.
On physical examination, her BP was elevated at 162/94 mmHg on the right arm in a seated position, confirmed by repeat measurements. HR was 88 bpm and regular. BMI was 23.1 kg/m². There were no significant findings on auscultation of the heart and lungs. No edema, thyroid enlargement, or abdominal masses were noted. Neurological examination revealed mild proximal muscle weakness in the lower extremities, but deep tendon reflexes were normal.
Initial laboratory evaluations revealed serum K of 2.8 mmol/L, with low-normal serum Mg, and Na within normal limits. Renal function tests showed a serum creatinine of 0.82 mg/dL and an eGFR of 98 mL/min/1.73 m². Lipid profiles showed total cholesterol of 204 mg/dL, LDL-C of 144 mg/dL, and HDL-C of 38 mg/dL. Fasting blood glucose and HbA1c were within normal ranges. Plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) was significantly elevated at 35 ng/dL, and plasma renin activity (PRA) was suppressed at 0.3 ng/mL/h, yielding an aldosterone/renin ratio (ARR) of 116.5 ng/dL per ng/mL/h. A 24-hour urinary aldosterone excretion was elevated at 24.7 µg/day. Imaging via abdominal CT revealed a 1.8-cm, hypodense nodule in the left adrenal gland with no evidence of malignancy. Adrenal vein sampling confirmed a lateralized aldosterone overproduction on the left side.
The patient was diagnosed with primary aldosteronism due to an aldosterone-producing adenoma. After a thorough discussion of treatment options, she underwent laparoscopic left adrenalectomy. Postoperatively, she was started on spironolactone at 25 mg/day temporarily until normalization of serum K was confirmed. Her postoperative course was uneventful, and serum K normalized to 4.1 mmol/L, while BP improved to 128/80 mmHg two weeks post-surgery without the need for antihypertensive therapy.
At a follow-up visit three months after surgery, her BP remained well-controlled at 122/78 mmHg without pharmacologic intervention, and serum K levels were stable. LDL-C had improved to 113 mg/dL following dietary counseling. The patient reported a significant improvement in her overall quality of life with complete resolution of palpitations, fatigue, and muscle weakness."
