"A 52-year-old female presented with intermittent chest pain and a sour taste sensation in her mouth that had persisted for six months. The symptoms were often triggered by large meals, lying down immediately after eating, or consuming acidic and spicy foods. She reported symptom worsening at nighttime, leading to disturbed sleep. She described the chest pain as a burning sensation located in the epigastric region and occasionally radiating towards the sternum. No history of weight loss, dysphagia, or hematemesis was reported. She also reported chronic bloating and irregular bowel habits, consistent with a prior diagnosis of IBS.
On physical examination, her vital signs were unremarkable. She had no significant findings upon cardiopulmonary or abdominal examination. There was no tenderness upon palpation of the epigastric area. Digital rectal examination was deferred due to lack of rectal symptoms. No other abnormalities were noted.
EGD showed evidence of esophagitis with erythema in the distal esophagus but no erosions or ulcers. There was no evidence of Barrettâ€™s esophagus or hiatal hernia. Esophageal biopsies were taken to rule out eosinophilic esophagitis, which returned negative. Ambulatory 24-hour pH monitoring revealed an increased frequency of acid reflux episodes, with more episodes occurring in the supine position during the nighttime. Upper abdominal US revealed no abnormalities in the liver, pancreas, or gallbladder.
She was diagnosed with GERD based on the combination of her clinical symptoms, objective evidence of esophagitis on EGD, and the results of 24-hour pH monitoring. IBS was considered unlikely to contribute to her current symptoms of retrosternal burning and sour regurgitation.
She was started on omeprazole 20 mg orally once daily, taken 30 minutes before breakfast. The patient was also advised on lifestyle modifications, including elevating the head of her bed, avoiding meals two to three hours before lying down, and limiting intake of caffeine, alcohol, and spicy or acidic foods. After a four-week follow-up, she reported significant improvement in her symptoms, with only occasional mild burning sensation after large meals. Her omeprazole dosage was maintained, and she was instructed to continue her dietary modifications. She was advised to return for reassessment if symptoms persisted or worsened despite ongoing treatment."
