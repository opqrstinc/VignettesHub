"A 34-year-old female presented with a 4-day history of fever, non-productive cough, and generalized fatigue. She reported that these symptoms began abruptly and progressively worsened. She denied chest pain, dyspnea, anosmia, ageusia, sore throat, or gastrointestinal symptoms. There was no significant past medical history, and she was not taking any medications. She had no recent travel history or known exposure to individuals with confirmed cases of infectious diseases, although she worked in a crowded office environment. Additionally, she denied any history of smoking, substance use, or significant allergies.
On physical examination, the patient was found to have a body temperature of 38.9°C, a HR of 104 bpm, BP within normal limits, RR of 18 breaths per minute, and SpO2 of 94% on room air. She appeared fatigued but was alert and oriented. Lung auscultation revealed bilateral crackles, predominantly at the lung bases, without wheezing or pleural rub. There were no notable findings in the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, or neurological systems.
Laboratory findings revealed an elevated WBC count (predominantly lymphopenia), CRP at 39 mg/L, elevated D-dimer levels, and ferritin at 450 ng/mL. Procalcitonin was within normal limits. ABG on room air demonstrated a pH of 7.42, PaCO2 of 38 mmHg, and PaO2 of 78 mmHg. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected via RT-PCR testing from a nasopharyngeal swab. A chest CT scan revealed ground-glass opacities bilaterally, more pronounced in the peripheral and posterior regions of both lungs, consistent with viral pneumonia.
The clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings were consistent with COVID-19. Given the patient’s oxygen saturation and absence of severe respiratory compromise, she was diagnosed with mild-to-moderate COVID-19.
Treatment included supportive care with antipyretics (acetaminophen, 650 mg orally every 6 hours as needed for fever) and hydration. She was prescribed an oral course of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (300 mg/100 mg twice daily for 5 days) as she met criteria for use based on symptom duration and risk mitigation. Additionally, supplemental oxygen was not required, and no antibiotics were deemed necessary as there was no evidence of secondary bacterial infection. She was advised to self-isolate, monitor symptoms, and seek medical attention if oxygen saturation dropped below 90% or if severe symptoms developed.
Over the following week, the patient reported significant improvement in symptoms, including resolution of fever and reduction in cough and fatigue. She completed her 5-day antiviral course without incident. On day 10, a telehealth follow-up revealed that she had returned to her daily activities without limitations, and her SpO2 on room air was consistently above 96%. No post-treatment complications or persistent symptoms were noted."
