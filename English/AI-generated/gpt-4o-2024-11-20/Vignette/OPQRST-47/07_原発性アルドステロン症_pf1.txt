"A 35-year-old male presented with persistent headaches worsening over the past 3 months. The headaches were described as occipital, dull, and non-radiating, with no association to specific triggers. The patient also reported intermittent muscle weakness and occasional episodes of palpitations. He denied other neurological symptoms, chest pain, dyspnea, or gastrointestinal complaints. There was no significant past medical history, and he was not taking any medications. His family history was unremarkable for hypertension, endocrine disorders, or cardiovascular diseases. He denied tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drug use.
On physical examination, his BP was elevated at 165/100 mmHg, measured in both arms on multiple occasions. Pulse was 88 bpm and regular. BMI was within the normal range, and no abnormalities were noted in the general, head and neck, cardiac, respiratory, or neurological examinations. There were no signs of secondary causes of hypertension, such as abdominal bruits, peripheral edema, or retinopathy.
Laboratory testing revealed hypokalemia with a serum K+ concentration of 2.9 mmol/L, while Na+ levels were within the normal range. Renal function tests, including BUN and Cr, were normal. Plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) was elevated at 35 ng/dL, and plasma renin activity (PRA) was suppressed at 0.2 ng/mL/hr, resulting in an aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR) suggestive of primary hyperaldosteronism. A confirmatory saline infusion test showed non-suppressible aldosterone levels. In addition, 24-hour urinary K+ excretion was elevated, consistent with excessive renal K+ wasting. Serum cortisol and ACTH were within normal limits. Imaging studies, including a CT scan of the abdomen, disclosed a 1.5 cm unilateral adrenal mass on the left side, with no evidence of malignancy or metastasis. Adrenal venous sampling (AVS) confirmed lateralized aldosterone secretion.
The patient was diagnosed with primary aldosteronism, specifically an aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA).
Treatment included laparoscopic adrenalectomy, which was performed without complications. Post-operatively, the patient remained hemodynamically stable, and his K+ levels normalized within 48 hours. BP improved significantly, reducing to 130/85 mmHg without requiring antihypertensive therapy. Follow-up PAC and PRA levels demonstrated normalization, indicating successful removal of the aldosterone-secreting adenoma. For symptomatic management of hypertension and hypokalemia prior to surgery, spironolactone (50 mg twice daily) had been prescribed and was discontinued post-operatively.
At the 3-month follow-up, the patient remained normotensive with no recurrence of hypokalemia or related symptoms. Electrolytes and hormonal panels remained stable, and no additional interventions were required."
