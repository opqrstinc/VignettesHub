"A 40-year-old male presented with progressive right foot pain, coldness, and ulceration over a two-month period. He first noticed intermittent pain in the arch of his right foot while resting, which later became constant. Over the subsequent weeks, the pain intensified and was accompanied by subjective coldness in the foot. One month prior to presentation, he observed a non-healing ulcer over the dorsum of the right foot. There was no history of trauma, fever, or systemic symptoms. He denied claudication or similar symptoms in the contralateral limb. He had a 20-year history of smoking one pack per day but reported no prior medical history, including diabetes, hypertension, or hyperlipidemia. He reported no use of over-the-counter or prescription medications.
Physical examination revealed a thin male in no acute distress. The right foot was cool to touch with dependent rubor and pallor upon elevation. Ulceration was present over the dorsum, measuring approximately 1 cm in diameter with clean edges and without signs of active infection. Capillary refill time was delayed in the digits of the right foot. There were no appreciable femoral, popliteal, or dorsalis pedis pulses on the right, while the left lower extremity pulses were palpable. The ankle-brachial index (ABI) was measured at 0.5 on the right and 1.0 on the left. There were no stigmata of connective tissue disease, and bilateral hands showed no signs of Raynaud's phenomenon or other abnormalities.
Laboratory testing revealed normal CBC, basic metabolic panel, liver function tests, and coagulation studies. Inflammatory markers, including ESR and CRP, were mildly elevated. Serologies for ANA, dsDNA, anti-cardiolipin, and rheumatologic markers were negative. Duplex ultrasonography of the right lower extremity showed decreased arterial flow distally, with no evidence of embolism or significant atherosclerosis. Arteriography demonstrated segmental occlusive disease in the medium and small-sized arteries of the foot and hand, with a classic “corkscrew” collateral pattern. There were no proximal large-vessel abnormalities.
The patient was diagnosed with thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO) based on his history of tobacco use, clinical symptoms, imaging findings, and the absence of alternate causes such as atherosclerosis or autoimmune vasculitis.
Management included complete smoking cessation, which was emphasized as the cornerstone of treatment. Behavioral counseling, along with nicotine replacement therapy in the form of a transdermal nicotine patch (21 mg/day), was initiated. The patient was started on aspirin 81 mg daily to reduce thrombotic risk and received wound care for the foot ulcer with non-adhesive dressings and local debridement as needed. He was also prescribed cilostazol 100 mg twice daily to improve blood flow and relieve symptoms of ischemia. Prostacyclin analogs were not initiated at this stage.
Over the next six months, the patient demonstrated significant clinical improvement. He reported cessation of pain in his right foot and gradual healing of the ulcer. Follow-up ABI improved to 0.8 on the affected side. He continued on smoking cessation support, aspirin, and cilostazol, with ongoing emphasis on lifestyle modifications to prevent disease progression."
