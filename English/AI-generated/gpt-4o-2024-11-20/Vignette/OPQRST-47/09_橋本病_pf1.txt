"A 45-year-old female presented with progressive weight gain and fatigue over the past six months. She reported difficulty concentrating, generalized muscle weakness, and cold intolerance. She denied any significant changes in appetite or dietary habits. Her past medical history included well-controlled hypertension treated with amlodipine 5 mg daily. She denied any smoking or alcohol use and had no significant family history of thyroid disorders or autoimmune diseases.
On physical examination, her BP was 135/85 mmHg, HR was 68 bpm, and her BMI was 27.2 kg/m². Examination revealed dry, coarse skin, facial puffiness, and mild periorbital edema. There was noticeable thinning of the lateral third of her eyebrows. Palpation of the neck revealed a diffusely enlarged, non-tender thyroid gland without nodules. Heart and lung examinations were unremarkable, and deep tendon reflexes demonstrated delayed relaxation.
Laboratory testing showed elevated TSH levels at 47 µIU/mL (reference range: 0.4–4.5), and free T4 was decreased at 0.7 ng/dL (reference range: 0.8–1.8). Anti-thyroid peroxidase (TPOAb) and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAb) were markedly elevated, suggesting autoimmune thyroiditis. CBC revealed mild normocytic anemia, with Hb at 11.5 g/dL. Electrolytes, renal function, and liver function tests were within normal limits. Lipid panel demonstrated elevated total cholesterol at 240 mg/dL and LDL at 160 mg/dL. An US of the thyroid showed a diffusely hypoechoic gland with no focal nodules.
The patient was diagnosed with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, presenting as primary hypothyroidism. Treatment was initiated with levothyroxine at a dose of 75 mcg daily. She was advised to take the medication on an empty stomach in the morning to optimize absorption. BP management with amlodipine was continued without dose adjustment, as her BP remained well-controlled.
At the 6-week follow-up, her symptoms of fatigue and cold intolerance improved significantly. Repeat testing showed a reduction in TSH to 6.8 µIU/mL and an increase in free T4 to 1.2 ng/dL. The levothyroxine dose was adjusted to 100 mcg daily. Over the subsequent visits at 3 and 6 months, her symptoms, including muscle weakness and facial puffiness, resolved completely. Repeat TSH levels normalized to 2.1 µIU/mL, and free T4 remained within the normal range. Weight stabilization was noted, and the patient reported overall improvement in quality of life. Regular follow-up was planned to monitor thyroid function and adjust the medication dose as needed."
