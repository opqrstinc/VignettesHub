"A 35-year-old male presented with progressive fatigue, anorexia, and jaundice for one week. He denied any preceding illnesses, recent travel, or high-risk behaviors such as intravenous drug use or multiple sexual partners. The patient reported darkened urine and pale stools over the past several days. He denied significant weight loss, fever, abdominal pain, or prior episodes of similar symptoms. He had no personal or family history of liver disease, alcohol abuse, or other chronic conditions. His past medical history and medication use were unremarkable.
On physical examination, the patient appeared icteric with yellow sclerae, but was alert and in no acute distress. His vital signs were T 37.0°C, BP 118/78 mmHg, HR 88 bpm, and SpO2 98% on room air. Abdominal examination revealed mild tenderness in the right upper quadrant without hepatomegaly, ascites, or palpable masses. There was no stigmata of chronic liver disease, and no peripheral edema or lymphadenopathy was noted. The remainder of the physical examination was unremarkable.
Laboratory evaluation showed elevated AST (862 IU/L), ALT (1085 IU/L), and total bilirubin (7.4 mg/dL) with a conjugated fraction of 5.2 mg/dL. ALP was mildly elevated at 145 IU/L, while albumin and PT/INR were within normal limits. HBV serology demonstrated a positive HBsAg, elevated HBV DNA levels of 3.2 × 10⁶ IU/mL, and negative anti-HBs. Anti-HBc IgM was positive, supporting a diagnosis of acute HBV infection. Serologic tests for HAV, HCV, and HEV were negative. Autoimmune markers, including ANA, ASMA, and LKM-1, were not detected, and ceruloplasmin levels were within the normal range. An ultrasound of the liver demonstrated no evidence of biliary obstruction, masses, or cirrhosis, and the liver echotexture was normal.
Based on clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and imaging, the diagnosis of acute HBV infection was established. Given the absence of significant coagulopathy or encephalopathy, the case was categorized as acute HBV without fulminant liver failure.
The patient was advised to rest, maintain adequate hydration, and avoid alcohol or hepatotoxic medications. As his serum HBV DNA levels were significantly elevated and the bilirubin was above 3 mg/dL, antiviral therapy was initiated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) at a dose of 300 mg once daily. Other supportive measures included monitoring for symptoms of worsening liver dysfunction and providing dietary advice to reduce metabolic strain on the liver.
Over the subsequent two weeks, the patient experienced gradual improvement in fatigue and appetite. Follow-up bloodwork after four weeks of treatment showed a decline in AST (112 IU/L), ALT (146 IU/L), and total bilirubin (2.1 mg/dL). HBsAg remained positive, but HBV DNA levels decreased significantly (<200 IU/mL). His clinical condition continued to improve, and no complications, such as hepatic encephalopathy or coagulopathy, were observed. He was advised to continue TDF therapy and return for regular monitoring of liver function tests and HBV serology."
