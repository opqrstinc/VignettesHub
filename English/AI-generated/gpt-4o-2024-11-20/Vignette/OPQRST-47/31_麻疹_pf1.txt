"A 5-year-old male presented to the clinic with a 3-day history of fever, cough, and a skin rash. The fever began abruptly, reaching up to 39.8°C, and was accompanied by a persistent non-productive cough and rhinorrhea. On the second day, his parents noticed redness in his eyes, accompanied by mild photophobia. By the third day, the patient developed a diffuse erythematous maculopapular rash, which began on the face and subsequently spread caudally to involve the trunk and extremities. Family members denied any previous similar illnesses, and his vaccination history was incomplete, with no record of receiving the MMR vaccine. There was no significant past medical history or history of recent travel.
On physical examination, the child appeared visibly ill and was febrile with a temperature of 39.5°C. Conjunctival injection and mild upper eyelid edema were noted bilaterally. Oral examination revealed erythematous oropharynx and the presence of multiple small, bluish-white spots with an erythematous halo on the buccal mucosa, consistent with Koplik spots. Auscultation of the lungs revealed bilateral scattered rhonchi but no significant wheezing or rales. The maculopapular rash was noted diffusely over the face, neck, trunk, and extremities, sparing the palms and soles. No lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, or other abnormalities were detected.
Laboratory findings included leukopenia (WBC 3,200/μL) and thrombocytopenia (platelets 98,000/μL). CRP and ESR levels were mildly elevated. Serum IgM and IgG for measles were markedly elevated, confirming acute infection. Viral RNA from a nasopharyngeal swab tested positive for measles virus by RT-PCR. A chest X-ray demonstrated mild perihilar infiltrates suggestive of viral pneumonitis. No bacterial superinfection or complications were observed.
The diagnosis of measles was confirmed based on clinical findings, elevated measles-specific IgM, and positive RT-PCR results. The patient was managed with supportive care, including adequate hydration and antipyretics (acetaminophen, dosed at 15 mg/kg every 4–6 hours as needed for fever). Vitamin A supplementation was initiated at a dosage of 200,000 IU orally once daily for two consecutive days, as per WHO recommendations for children over one year of age with measles. Symptomatic relief for cough was provided with honey-based lozenges; however, no specific antitussives were administered. The patient was monitored closely for complications, including secondary bacterial infections, otitis media, and pneumonia.
Over the next 7 days, fever resolved by day 5 of illness, and the rash began to fade in the classic cephalocaudal sequence, leaving behind a transient desquamation of affected areas. Photophobia and conjunctivitis subsided entirely by day 6. Scheduled follow-up 1 week after discharge revealed complete recovery without residual symptoms or complications. The patient's guardians were counseled extensively on the importance of completing age-appropriate vaccination schedules, particularly the MMR vaccine, to prevent future occurrences of preventable infectious diseases."
