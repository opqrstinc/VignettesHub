"A 51-year-old male with a history of DM presented to the clinic with progressive fatigue and dyspnea, particularly worsening with physical exertion over the past 3 months. He reported intermittent diplopia and ptosis, which were more pronounced toward the evening. He also stated experiencing generalized weakness, especially in the proximal limbs, alongside difficulty chewing and swallowing solid foods. No recent infections, head injuries, or medication changes were noted. He had a 10-year history of well-controlled type 2 DM managed with metformin.
On physical examination, the patient appeared fatigued but was alert and oriented. Neurological evaluation revealed bilateral ptosis, more evident on prolonged upward gaze. Ocular movements were restricted in all directions but worsened with sustained gaze, suggesting fatigable weakness. Proximal muscle strength was decreased symmetrically in both upper and lower extremities (4/5 on the MRC scale), while distal strength remained intact. Reflexes were preserved, and sensory examination showed no abnormalities. No fasciculations or muscle atrophy were noted. Respiratory examination revealed shallow breathing but no use of accessory muscles. Cardiovascular and abdominal examinations were unremarkable.
Laboratory tests demonstrated normal CBC, CMP, and thyroid function tests. HgbA1c was 6.8%, consistent with his history of DM. Serum AChR-Ab was markedly elevated at 22 nmol/L (reference range <0.5 nmol/L). Electrodiagnostic studies, including repetitive nerve stimulation, showed a >20% decrement in the amplitude of CMAPs at a frequency of 3 Hz, consistent with NMJ dysfunction. Chest CT revealed an anterior mediastinal mass measuring 3.2 cm, highly suggestive of a thymoma. Additional imaging, including brain MRI, showed no central nervous system abnormalities.
Based on the clinical presentation, serologic findings, and electrophysiological studies, a diagnosis of MG associated with thymoma was established. The patient was admitted for further management due to concerns about potential respiratory compromise.
Initial treatment included pyridostigmine at a dose of 60 mg orally every 6 hours, which provided some relief of symptoms. In addition, prednisone was started at 20 mg orally once daily, with plans for gradual titration. For rapid symptom control, IVIG was administered at a dose of 2 g/kg over 5 days. Following stabilization of his symptoms, a thoracic surgeon was consulted, and the patient underwent thymectomy. Postoperatively, his symptoms showed significant improvement, and the need for prednisone was eventually tapered.
Over the next 3 months, the patient was closely followed up, during which his ptosis, generalized weakness, and dyspnea progressively resolved. Maintenance therapy with pyridostigmine continued, and no major adverse effects were noted. Repeat serologic testing demonstrated a gradual decline in AChR-Ab levels. Frequent monitoring was implemented to assess for potential disease recurrence or complications related to his underlying DM. Regular pulmonary function tests showed stable results without significant decline, and at his 6-month follow-up, he reported a marked improvement in his quality of life."
