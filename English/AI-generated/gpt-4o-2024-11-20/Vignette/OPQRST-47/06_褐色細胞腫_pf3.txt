"A 28-year-old male presented with complaints of palpitations, shortness of breath, and excessive sweating that had been recurring intermittently over the past three months. Episodes were described as sudden and lasted several minutes to an hour. Symptoms were often accompanied by severe headaches, anxiety, and elevated blood pressure. He denied any prior diagnosis of hypertension, family history of endocrine or hereditary disorders, or the use of medications or stimulant substances.
On physical examination, his BP was elevated to 180/100 mmHg during one of the symptomatic episodes, with HR reaching 120 bpm. During asymptomatic intervals, BP normalized to 130/80 mmHg, and HR was within normal limits. There were no significant findings on cardiovascular or respiratory examination, and no palpable abdominal masses were noted. His BMI was within normal range.
Laboratory investigations revealed elevated 24-hour urinary metanephrines and normetanephrines, with plasma-free metanephrines also significantly raised, consistent with catecholamine hypersecretion. A CT scan of the abdomen identified a 3-cm mass in the right adrenal gland, with imaging characteristics suggestive of a pheochromocytoma. Additional functional imaging with ^123I-MIBG confirmed increased radiotracer uptake in the right adrenal lesion, and further studies excluded metastasis or extra-adrenal involvement.
The patient was diagnosed with a right adrenal pheochromocytoma. Preoperative management included alpha-adrenergic blockade with phenoxybenzamine, initiated at 10 mg orally twice daily, titrated to 20 mg three times daily over 10 days. Adequate alpha blockade was confirmed by symptom resolution, stabilization of BP, and mild postural hypotension. Beta-blockade with propranolol, 20 mg orally twice daily, was subsequently introduced to control persistent tachycardia after adequate alpha blockade was achieved.
He underwent laparoscopic adrenalectomy, during which the adrenal mass was successfully excised. Intraoperative hemodynamic instability was managed with short-acting IV antihypertensives such as nitroprusside. Postoperative recovery was uneventful. Histopathological analysis of the excised mass confirmed a pheochromocytoma consistent with resected tumor findings.
Postoperatively, catecholamine and metanephrine levels normalized, and BP remained stable without the need for antihypertensive medications. Follow-up at one month showed no recurrence of symptoms. Regular monitoring, including biochemical assessments and imaging, was planned to screen for recurrent or residual disease."
