"A 28-year-old female presented with a chief complaint of severe unilateral headache localized to the right temporal region, accompanied by nausea and photophobia. The headache began approximately 12 hours prior to her presentation and was described as throbbing in nature with an intensity rated as 8 out of 10 on a pain scale. She reported prior episodes of similar headaches occurring approximately once or twice per month over the past three years. These episodes were typically associated with visual disturbances, including flashing lights (scotomas), and were often provoked by stress, lack of sleep, or certain food triggers such as chocolate and red wine. The current episode had started suddenly after a stressful event and progressively worsened in intensity. She denied fever, neck stiffness, weakness, or other neurological deficits. 
On physical examination, she appeared in discomfort, with her right hand holding the affected temporal region. Vital signs were stable with BP 122/76 mmHg, HR 78 bpm, RR 16 breaths per minute, and temperature 36.8Â°C. Neurological examination was unremarkable with no focal deficits, intact cranial nerve function, and normal reflexes. Fundoscopic exam showed no evidence of papilledema. A basic HEENT examination revealed no signs of sinus tenderness, but mild sensitivity to light was noted during the exam.
Head CT was performed with normal findings, ruling out acute secondary causes of headache such as intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect. Routine laboratory evaluation, including CBC, CMP, and inflammatory markers such as CRP and ESR, yielded results within normal limits. Given the patient's age, clinical presentation, and history of similar episodes consistent with migraine without aura, no further imaging, such as MRI, was deemed necessary.
She was diagnosed with an acute migraine episode. Based on her symptoms and clinical history, treatment was initiated with sumatriptan, a 50 mg oral dose, which she was instructed to repeat after 2 hours if the headache persisted. Supportive care included oral hydration and a dark, quiet environment to minimize light and noise exposure. She was also given ondansetron 4 mg orally as needed for nausea.
Within two hours of initial treatment, the patient reported significant pain relief with near resolution of nausea and photophobia. She was observed in the clinic for an additional 60 minutes without recurrence of symptoms. Detailed discharge instructions were provided, including education on avoiding known triggers, proper hydration, and maintaining a regular sleep schedule. She was prescribed sumatriptan 50 mg for PRN use during future migraine episodes and was encouraged to maintain a headache diary to identify triggers and monitor the frequency and severity of attacks. Follow-up was arranged in 4 weeks to assess symptom control and consider prophylactic therapy if migraine frequency or severity increased. No adverse events were reported during treatment."
