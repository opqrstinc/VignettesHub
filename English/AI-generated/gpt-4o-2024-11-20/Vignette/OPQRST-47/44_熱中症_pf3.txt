"A 68-year-old male presented to the emergency department complaining of dizziness, headache, and muscle cramps. The symptoms started approximately two hours earlier while he was working outdoors in high ambient temperatures during the midday. He reported that the symptoms progressively worsened, leading to significant discomfort. He noted excessive sweating earlier but mentioned that his skin later felt dry despite the persistent heat. His fluid intake during the day was minimal, and he had no prior similar episodes. He denied experiencing chest pain, palpitations, or other systemic complaints.
On physical examination, his temperature was 40.3°C, HR was 120 bpm, BP was 94/60 mmHg, RR was 22/min, and SpO2 was 97% on room air. He appeared confused and lethargic. His skin was flushed and dry to the touch. Examination revealed no evidence of trauma, but he exhibited mild ataxia. Neurological exam did not demonstrate focal deficits, but the patient was disoriented to time and place. Auscultation revealed clear lung sounds bilaterally, and cardiovascular examination showed tachycardia without murmurs.
Initial laboratory results revealed several abnormalities. Na was 151 mEq/L, Cl was 113 mEq/L, K was 3.8 mEq/L. Serum BUN was elevated at 28 mg/dL, and Cr was 1.6 mg/dL. ABG demonstrated metabolic acidosis with mild respiratory compensation: pH 7.30, HCO3- 18 mEq/L, PCO2 33 mmHg. CK was significantly elevated at 1,200 U/L, indicative of rhabdomyolysis. Liver function tests were notable for AST of 145 U/L and ALT of 110 U/L. Coagulation tests demonstrated prolonged PT and a mild elevation in D-dimer, raising concerns for potential coagulopathy. UA revealed concentrated urine with a specific gravity of 1.030 but was negative for blood or protein. Chest X-Ray and ECG were unremarkable.
The patient was diagnosed with classic heatstroke based on clinical presentation, elevated core temperature, neurologic dysfunction, and laboratory findings consistent with dehydration, rhabdomyolysis, and organ dysfunction.
Aggressive cooling and volume resuscitation were initiated immediately. Evaporative cooling was performed by applying tepid water to the body while using fans to facilitate evaporation. The patient received IV 0.9% NS at a rate of 500 mL/hour initially, followed by adjustments based on urine output and hemodynamic response. Cooling measures were continued until his core temperature decreased to 38.5°C. Repeated ABG and electrolytes were monitored every 2 hours. Rhabdomyolysis was managed by maintaining high urine output; he received IV fluids titrated to achieve a urine output of 200–300 mL/hour. No diuretics were administered. Acetaminophen was administered solely for symptomatic headache relief at 650 mg every 6 hours as needed. Antipyretics such as NSAIDs were avoided because they were deemed unnecessary for heat-induced hyperthermia.
Over the course of 24 hours, the patient showed significant clinical improvement. His mental status normalized as his core temperature was successfully maintained below 38.0°C. Laboratory monitoring showed progressive normalization of Na, BUN, Cr, and CK levels. On the third day, he was discharged with instructions to avoid prolonged heat exposure, maintain adequate hydration, and seek follow-up care with his primary physician."
