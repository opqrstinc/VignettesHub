"A 70-year-old male presented with a chief complaint of transient right-sided hemiparesis and monocular vision loss in the left eye that resolved spontaneously within 20 minutes. The symptoms occurred suddenly while he was sitting at home and were not associated with headache, vertigo, or altered consciousness. He reported no chest pain, palpitations, or recent trauma. He denied a prior history of similar episodes. His medical history was notable for type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed 10 years earlier, managed with metformin 1,000 mg twice daily, and no history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, or smoking. He had no prior history of cerebrovascular or cardiovascular disease.
On physical examination, the patient was alert and oriented with normal vital signs, including a BP of 130/80 mmHg. Neurological examination showed no residual deficits, with intact motor strength and sensation in all extremities, normal cranial nerve function, and symmetrical reflexes. Fundoscopic examination revealed no retinal abnormalities. Cardiovascular examination did not detect murmurs, irregular rhythms, or carotid bruits. No other significant findings were observed.
Diagnostic workup included cranial MRI and MRA, which showed no acute infarction or vascular abnormality, respectively. Carotid duplex ultrasound revealed a 60% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) was unremarkable, showing normal ejection fraction without valvular or thromboembolic sources. Routine blood testing, including CBC, renal function, and electrolytes, was within normal limits. HbA1c level was elevated at 7.5%. A lipid panel indicated LDL of 145 mg/dL and total cholesterol of 220 mg/dL. ECG demonstrated normal sinus rhythm without ischemic changes or arrhythmias.
The clinical presentation and findings led to a diagnosis of transient ischemic attack (TIA) due to large-artery atherosclerosis of the left internal carotid. This was classified under the ABCD² score as high risk, with a score of 5 points (age ≥ 60, symptoms of hemiparesis, duration > 10 minutes, diabetes mellitus).
The patient was started on high-dose atorvastatin 80 mg daily to manage dyslipidemia and reduce future atherosclerotic risk. Dual antiplatelet therapy was initiated with aspirin 81 mg daily and clopidogrel 75 mg daily for 21 days, followed by aspirin monotherapy. Blood glucose control was optimized by increasing the dose of his current metformin to 1,500 mg twice daily. Additionally, lifestyle modifications, including recommendations for a low-sodium, low-fat diet and increased physical activity, were emphasized. The patient was referred for vascular surgery consultation to discuss potential carotid endarterectomy due to the significant stenosis in the left carotid artery.
Follow-up at one month revealed no recurrence of neurological symptoms. Lipid levels showed improvement with a reduction in LDL to 90 mg/dL and total cholesterol to 180 mg/dL. Carotid revascularization was successfully performed two months after the initial presentation. The patient continued to do well with adherence to medical treatment and lifestyle changes during subsequent follow-up visits."
