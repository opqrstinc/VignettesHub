"A 13-year-old male presented with a three-week history of episodes of wheezing, nocturnal shortness of breath, and a persistent dry cough. The symptoms were more pronounced at night and during physical activity, such as playing soccer at school. He reported no recent upper respiratory infections, fever, or sick contacts. His mother noted that symptoms worsened after exposure to dust and cold air. He had a history of atopic dermatitis diagnosed in early childhood but no prior documented episodes of respiratory distress. There was no family history of asthma, but his father had allergic rhinitis. No history of smoking or passive smoke exposure was noted.
On physical examination, the patient appeared well-nourished but displayed mild respiratory distress. Vital signs revealed a mildly elevated respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 94% on room air, and no fever. Auscultation of the lungs revealed bilateral expiratory wheezes, predominantly in the upper and middle lung fields. There were no crackles or decreased breath sounds. Skin examination showed post-inflammatory hyperpigmented patches consistent with atopic dermatitis on the antecubital fossae. Cardiovascular, abdominal, and neurological exams were unremarkable.
Spirometry demonstrated an FEV1 of 65% and an FEV1/FVC ratio of 0.65, indicating obstructive airway disease. Post-bronchodilator testing with albuterol (90 mcg per puff, two puffs via MDI) revealed a 15% improvement in FEV1, confirming reversible airway obstruction consistent with asthma. Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) was elevated at 45 ppb, supporting eosinophilic airway inflammation. Peripheral blood counts showed a mild eosinophilia of 8%, and total IgE was elevated at 450 IU/mL. Allergy testing via serum-specific IgE was positive for dust mites and grass pollen. Chest X-ray was unremarkable, showing no evidence of infection or hyperinflation.
The patient was diagnosed with moderate persistent asthma. Treatment was initiated with inhaled fluticasone/salmeterol at a dose of 100 mcg/50 mcg, one inhalation twice daily via a dry powder inhaler. Albuterol sulfate (90 mcg per puff) was prescribed as a rescue inhaler to be used as needed for acute symptoms. A leukotriene receptor antagonist, montelukast, 5 mg once daily, was also added. His parents were educated on the proper use of inhalers, the importance of adherence to therapy, and the identification of potential triggers.
At the two-week follow-up, the patient reported significant improvement in symptoms, with no episodes of nocturnal dyspnea or wheezing. Spirometry demonstrated an improved FEV1 of 85%. He continued to use albuterol occasionally during physical activity. At the three-month follow-up, he remained symptom-free, with good asthma control as assessed by the Asthma Control Test (ACT) score of 25. Fluticasone/salmeterol therapy was continued, and montelukast was prescribed for long-term management. Regular follow-ups were planned to monitor symptoms and ensure adherence to treatment."
