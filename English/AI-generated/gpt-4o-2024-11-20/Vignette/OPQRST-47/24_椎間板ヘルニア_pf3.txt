"A 43-year-old female presented with a chief complaint of worsening low back pain and left-sided sciatica over the past four weeks. The patient described the pain as sharp and radiating from the lower back down to the posterior aspect of the left thigh and calf, occasionally reaching the lateral aspect of the foot. The pain initially started gradually without any clear trigger, but it had progressively worsened, significantly impairing her ability to perform daily activities such as bending, standing for prolonged periods, and walking. She rated the pain as 8/10 in severity on a numeric rating scale. She also reported intermittent numbness and paresthesia in the left leg but denied bowel or bladder dysfunction. Her medical history included intermittent episodes of mild low back pain for the past five years. She denied any history of trauma, recent infections, or systemic symptoms such as fever or weight loss. There was no relevant family history.
On physical examination, the patient appeared to be in mild distress due to pain. Vital signs were within normal limits. Lumbar spine inspection revealed no deformities, skin changes, or signs of external trauma. Palpation elicited tenderness over the L5-S1 paraspinal region. Lasegue's test (straight leg raise) was positive at 45 degrees on the left side, reproducing her sciatica symptoms. Motor examination showed grade 4/5 strength in the left extensor hallucis longus and ankle dorsiflexion, suggesting involvement of the L5 nerve root. Lower extremity reflexes revealed an absent left ankle reflex, while the patellar reflexes were intact bilaterally. Pinprick and light touch sensation were diminished over the left L5 distribution. No signs of upper motor neuron involvement or gait abnormalities were observed.
MRI of the lumbar spine demonstrated evidence of disc herniation at the L4-L5 level with left paracentral and foraminal extrusion, resulting in significant nerve root compression. There was no evidence of spinal stenosis, cauda equina syndrome, or other spinal pathologies. Plain radiographs of the lumbar spine were unremarkable, and routine laboratory studies, including CBC and CRP, were within normal limits.
The clinical presentation and imaging findings confirmed a diagnosis of lumbar disc herniation at L4-L5 causing symptomatic left-sided L5 radiculopathy.
The initial treatment focused on conservative management. The patient was prescribed oral NSAIDs (ibuprofen 600 mg every 6 hours as needed) for pain relief and inflammation. A short course of oral corticosteroids (prednisone 40 mg daily for 5 days, followed by a taper over 10 days) was administered to reduce nerve root edema. In addition, she was started on physical therapy, including exercises aimed at improving lumbar spine flexibility, core strength, and posture. Gabapentin was initiated at a dose of 300 mg once daily and titrated to 300 mg three times daily within one week to address neuropathic pain. She was advised to avoid activities that exacerbated her symptoms and to apply local heat therapy as necessary.
At the two-week follow-up, the patient reported significant pain relief, with a reduction of her symptoms to a 3/10 severity score. Motor strength in the left lower extremity improved to grade 5/5, and sensory deficits had nearly resolved. She continued physical therapy and medication as prescribed. At the eight-week follow-up, she reported only occasional mild discomfort after prolonged activity. Conservative treatment was deemed successful, and no surgical intervention was required."
