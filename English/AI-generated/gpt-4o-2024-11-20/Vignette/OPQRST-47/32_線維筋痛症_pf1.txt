"A 55-year-old female presented with a chief complaint of diffuse muscle pain, persistent fatigue, and unrefreshing sleep for the past six months. She reported that the symptoms had gradually worsened, becoming more debilitating over time. The patient described widespread, chronic pain across her shoulders, back, hips, and thighs, which she characterized as a dull, aching sensation. She also reported difficulty concentrating, referred to as ""fibro fog,"" and increased sensitivity to touch and pressure. Her symptoms were exacerbated by physical activity and stress. The patient denied any recent trauma, infections, or other specific triggers. Her medical history was notable for a previous diagnosis of major depressive disorder, for which she had been managed with sertraline 50 mg daily for the past three years. She denied any history of autoimmune disorders or other chronic medical conditions.
On physical examination, the patient appeared fatigued but was alert and oriented. There was no evidence of joint swelling, erythema, or deformity. Palpation of 18 predetermined tender points, including the bilateral trapezius, lateral epicondyles, and gluteal areas, elicited significant pain in 13 of them. Neurological examination revealed no motor weakness, sensory deficits, or abnormalities in reflexes. Cardiopulmonary and abdominal examinations showed no notable findings.
Laboratory investigations, including CBC, CMP, and inflammatory markers (ESR and CRP), were within normal limits, ruling out infectious or inflammatory processes. TSH and ANA tests were negative, excluding thyroid dysfunction and connective tissue diseases, respectively. Imaging studies, including X-rays of the affected regions, showed no abnormalities. These findings helped to exclude other differential diagnoses, such as rheumatoid arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica, or systemic lupus erythematosus.
The patient was diagnosed with fibromyalgia based on the revised 2016 criteria established by the American College of Rheumatology, which requires widespread pain lasting more than three months, without a clear alternative diagnosis, along with additional associated symptoms such as fatigue and sleep disturbances.
Initial treatment focused on a multimodal approach. Duloxetine 30 mg daily was prescribed, with plans to increase to 60 mg daily after one week, targeting both chronic pain and potential depressive symptoms. Additionally, pregabalin was initiated at 75 mg at bedtime to address neuropathic pain and sleep disturbances, with a titration plan to increase to 150 mg nightly within two weeks, based on tolerability. Non-pharmacological interventions included recommending low-impact aerobic exercises, such as walking or swimming, together with mindfulness-based stress reduction techniques. A referral to a physical therapist was made to assist with stretching and strengthening exercises to improve musculoskeletal function. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) was suggested to help manage symptoms of depression and explore potential coping strategies.
At the one-month follow-up visit, the patient reported slight improvement in pain intensity and sleep quality. Duloxetine had been well-tolerated, and pregabalin helped reduce nighttime discomfort. However, she continued to experience mild fatigue and cognitive difficulties. Exercise adherence and CBT sessions were reported as partially helpful. Plans were made to continue current medications, increase exercise intensity gradually, and reassess her progress in three months."
