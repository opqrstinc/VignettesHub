"A 33-year-old male presented with a chief complaint of persistently elevated BP and worsening hyperglycemia over the past 6 months. He reported a gradual weight gain of approximately 8 kg during this period, accompanied by significant fatigue, muscle weakness, and mood changes including irritability and depressive symptoms. He also noted increased bruising with minor trauma and purple striae primarily over the abdomen. He denied recent infections, changes in diet or exercise, or use of exogenous corticosteroids. His past medical history included OSA and hyperlipidemia, for which he was on a home CPAP device and atorvastatin 20 mg daily.
On physical examination, his BP was 168/102 mmHg. Central obesity with a BMI of 32 kg/m², prominent facial rounding, and a dorsocervical fat pad (""buffalo hump"") were noted. Multiple purplish striae measuring over 1 cm in width were present on the abdomen. Proximal muscle weakness was evident, particularly in the upper and lower extremities. Facial plethora and thinning of the skin with evidence of recent bruising were observed. No peripheral edema, hirsutism, or signs of deep venous thrombosis were noted.
Laboratory investigations revealed hyperglycemia with a fasting plasma glucose of 156 mg/dL and HbA1c of 7.2%. Serum electrolytes demonstrated hypokalemia with a potassium level of 3.1 mmol/L. Serum cortisol levels were elevated at 24.8 mcg/dL in the morning and failed to suppress following low-dose dexamethasone suppression testing (1 mg overnight), with a post-test cortisol level of 14.6 mcg/dL. ACTH was also elevated at 88 pg/mL. 24-hour urinary free cortisol excretion was markedly increased at 320 mcg. MRI of the pituitary revealed a 5 mm right-sided adenoma consistent with an ACTH-producing pituitary adenoma (Cushing’s disease). Imaging studies, including a chest X-ray and CT scan of the adrenal glands, ruled out ectopic ACTH production and primary adrenal pathology, confirming the diagnosis of ACTH-dependent Cushing syndrome.
The patient underwent transsphenoidal surgical resection of the pituitary adenoma. Postoperatively, hydrocortisone replacement therapy was initiated at a dose of 20 mg in the morning and 10 mg in the afternoon to prevent adrenal insufficiency. Initial recovery was uncomplicated, with gradual improvement in BP, glucose levels, and other symptoms. Over the subsequent 6 months, his fasting plasma glucose normalized, BP improved to 132/88 mmHg without antihypertensive medications, and he experienced a weight loss of 6 kg. A repeat 24-hour urinary free cortisol measurement and low-dose dexamethasone suppression test confirmed biochemical remission."
