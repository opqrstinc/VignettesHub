"A 28-year-old male presented with crampy abdominal pain and non-bloody diarrhea persisting for three months. He reported experiencing intermittent weight loss of approximately 5 kg during this period. He denied fever, vomiting, or hematochezia. The symptoms became progressively worse, with increased stool frequency up to 6 times daily and prominent postprandial discomfort. He also complained of fatigue and occasional nocturnal diarrhea. The patient had no significant past medical history, no past surgeries, and no family history of gastrointestinal diseases or malignancies. He denied use of NSAIDs, antibiotics, or recent travel.
On physical examination, he appeared well-nourished despite mild pallor. His vital signs were stable, with no signs of fever or tachycardia. The abdominal examination revealed mild distension with tenderness primarily localized to the right lower quadrant. There was no rebound tenderness or guarding, and bowel sounds were hyperactive. Digital rectal examination was normal, and there were no external skin abnormalities or signs of fistula formation.
Laboratory tests revealed Hb of 10.2 g/dL, indicating mild anemia, with MCV of 70 fL, suggestive of microcytosis. WBC and PLT counts were mildly elevated at 11,600/μL and 452,000/μL, respectively. CRP and ESR were elevated at 52 mg/L and 42 mm/hr, respectively, consistent with active inflammation. Serum iron and ferritin levels were decreased at 32 µg/dL and 18 ng/mL, indicating iron deficiency. CMP showed hypoalbuminemia of 3.1 g/dL. Stool studies were negative for infectious pathogens, ova, and parasites. Fecal calprotectin was markedly elevated at 480 µg/g, suggestive of intestinal inflammation.
Colonoscopy revealed patchy, erythematous, and ulcerated mucosa with cobblestone-like appearance in the terminal ileum and multiple strictures, while intervening areas of mucosa appeared normal. Multiple biopsies were taken, which demonstrated non-caseating granulomas and transmural inflammation, confirming the diagnosis of Crohn's disease. Imaging with MR enterography showed thickening of the ileal wall, skipped lesions, and mesenteric fat creeping.
The patient was started on prednisone 40 mg daily for induction of remission and was gradually tapered over 8 weeks. Maintenance therapy with adalimumab was initiated at 160 mg SC on day 0, 80 mg SC on day 14, followed by 40 mg SC every two weeks. Additionally, oral mesalamine at 2.4 g daily was started, and folic acid 1 mg daily was provided. An iron sulfate supplement (65 mg elemental iron daily) was administered to address iron deficiency anemia.
The patient tolerated therapy well, with significant reduction in abdominal pain and diarrhea by 6 weeks. At a 3-month follow-up, his stools normalized to 1-2 times per day, with no nocturnal symptoms. CRP and fecal calprotectin levels significantly improved, suggesting clinical and biochemical remission. Repeat colonoscopy at 6 months showed mucosal healing, with no active ulcers or strictures. Adalimumab was continued, and he remained in remission at one year."
