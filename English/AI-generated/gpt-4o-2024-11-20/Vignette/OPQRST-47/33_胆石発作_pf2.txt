"A 63-year-old male presented with sudden onset of severe right upper quadrant abdominal pain that began approximately 8 hours before presentation. The pain was constant, sharp, and radiated to the right shoulder. He reported associated nausea and multiple episodes of vomiting, as well as fever and chills. He denied any changes in bowel habits, urinary symptoms, or similar episodes in the past. On further questioning, he noted the development of yellowing of his sclera and dark urine over the past 2 days. His medical history was unremarkable, and he had no prior history of surgeries, allergies, or chronic illnesses. He denied alcohol or drug use, and his family history was non-contributory.
On physical examination, his temperature was 38.3°C, HR was 96 bpm, BP was 132/78 mmHg, and RR was 20 breaths/min. There was evident scleral icterus, no pale conjunctiva, and his abdomen was tender to palpation in the right upper quadrant with positive Murphy's sign. No rebound tenderness or guarding was present. The remainder of the physical examination, including cardiac and pulmonary findings, was unremarkable.
Laboratory evaluation revealed an elevated WBC count of 14,600/µL with a left shift. Hepatic function panel showed total bilirubin of 4.2 mg/dL, direct bilirubin of 3.5 mg/dL, AST of 88 U/L, ALT of 94 U/L, and ALP of 312 U/L. Lipase was within normal limits. Abdominal US demonstrated gallbladder wall thickening, pericholecystic fluid, and shadowing consistent with gallstones. The common bile duct was dilated to 8 mm. MRCP confirmed the presence of gallstones in the gallbladder and choledocholithiasis in the distal CBD.
The patient was diagnosed with acute cholangitis secondary to choledocholithiasis. He was started on IV piperacillin-tazobactam at a dose of 3.375 g every 6 hours to manage the infection. An urgent ERCP was performed, during which the obstructing stone was successfully extracted, and a biliary stent was placed to ensure drainage. Post-procedure, his abdominal pain and jaundice improved markedly. Antibiotic therapy was continued for a total of 7 days, followed by a planned laparoscopic cholecystectomy 4 weeks later to prevent recurrence. Post-cholecystectomy, his recovery was uneventful, and no further complications were reported."
