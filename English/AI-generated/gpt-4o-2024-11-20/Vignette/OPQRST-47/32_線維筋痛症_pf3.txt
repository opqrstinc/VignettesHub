"A 48-year-old female presented with a chief complaint of widespread musculoskeletal pain persisting for over six months. The pain was described as diffuse, non-localized, and affecting multiple areas including the neck, shoulders, back, and thighs. Accompanying symptoms included profound fatigue, morning stiffness lasting greater than one hour, and non-restorative sleep. She reported difficulty concentrating, referred to as ""fibro fog,"" and intermittent headaches. She experienced symptoms exacerbation during periods of stress and cold temperatures. There was no history of trauma preceding the onset of symptoms.
On physical examination, the patient appeared fatigued but in no acute distress. Vital signs were within normal limits. Tenderness was elicited at multiple tender points, including the bilateral trapezius, supraspinatus, gluteal regions, and lateral epicondyles, upon application of moderate pressure. There was no evidence of joint swelling, erythema, or deformity. Neurological examination revealed no focal deficits. Muscle strength and gait were normal. Cardiopulmonary and abdominal examinations were unremarkable.
Laboratory and imaging studies were conducted to rule out alternative diagnoses. CBC, CMP, ESR, CRP, and TSH were within normal limits. ANA and RF were negative. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were mildly decreased at 20 ng/mL. EMG was performed and showed no evidence of neuromuscular disease. Imaging, including X-rays of the cervical and lumbar spine, revealed degenerative changes appropriate for age but no other significant findings. Based on clinical symptoms, tender point examination, and exclusion of other conditions, a diagnosis of fibromyalgia (FM) was made.
The patient was initiated on amitriptyline 25 mg once daily at bedtime for its potential benefits in improving pain and sleep quality. Additionally, pregabalin 75 mg twice daily was prescribed, targeting neuropathic pain components. Gradual uptitration of pregabalin was planned based on patient response and tolerance. The patient was advised to adopt a low-impact aerobic exercise regimen, starting with walking or swimming, for 20â€“30 minutes thrice weekly, along with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to address maladaptive pain coping mechanisms and comorbid depression. Sleep hygiene techniques were reviewed to optimize restorative sleep. Further, vitamin D supplementation, consisting of cholecalciferol 1,000 IU daily, was initiated to rectify the deficiency.
Over the subsequent three months, the patient demonstrated gradual improvement in fatigue levels and pain severity, reporting a two-point reduction on the Numeric Pain Rating Scale. Sleep also improved, with fewer awakenings during the night and greater overall satisfaction with rest. However, intermittent symptom flares coinciding with psychological stressors were observed. Dosages of amitriptyline and pregabalin were maintained without significant adverse effects. Supportive therapies were continued, and the patient expressed satisfaction with the multidisciplinary treatment approach and was encouraged to maintain long-term adherence."
