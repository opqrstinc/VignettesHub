"A 30-year-old female presented with sudden onset of dyspnea, chest pain, and abdominal discomfort lasting approximately 20 minutes. The patient reported that the symptoms started abruptly while she was at work and were accompanied by a sense of impending doom and palpitations. She described the chest pain as sharp and central, without radiation, and the abdominal pain as cramping but non-specific in location. These episodes had occurred intermittently over the past six months, with increasing frequency and intensity. She had visited the emergency room twice in the previous three months, where extensive workups, including cardiac and gastrointestinal evaluations, were unremarkable. She reported that these episodes seemed to arise without clear triggers but often occurred during periods of stress. She also disclosed a history of major depressive disorder (MDD), for which she had been treated with sertraline 50 mg daily in the past but had stopped taking the medication one year earlier without medical supervision.
Physical exam revealed no acute abnormalities. BP was 128/80 mmHg, HR was 92 bpm, and SpO2 was 99% on room air. Cardiac, pulmonary, and abdominal examinations were unremarkable. Neurological assessment revealed no focal deficits. The patient appeared anxious and slightly diaphoretic during the examination but was alert and cooperative.
Diagnostic testing, including ECG, troponin levels, CBC, and comprehensive metabolic panel, showed no abnormalities. Chest radiography and D-dimer testing were within normal limits, effectively ruling out pulmonary embolism or other acute cardiopulmonary issues. A treadmill stress test and an echocardiogram, performed previously during one of her emergency room visits, were also normal. Thyroid function testing showed TSH and free T4 within normal limits, excluding thyroid dysfunction as a contributing factor. A psychological evaluation using the DSM-5 criteria confirmed a diagnosis of panic disorder (PD) based on recurrent, unexpected panic attacks and subsequent worry about having additional attacks.
The patient was initiated on sertraline 25 mg daily, titrated to 50 mg daily after one week, to target underlying PD. Psychotherapy, specifically cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), was recommended as a complementary treatment. Alprazolam 0.25 mg as needed, up to twice per day, was prescribed for acute symptom relief, with careful counseling on the risks of dependency. Lifestyle modifications, including stress management strategies and regular physical activity, were also emphasized.
One month later, the follow-up revealed significant improvement, with a reduction in the frequency and severity of panic attacks. The patient reported adherence to both sertraline and CBT sessions, and no adverse effects of the medication were noted. Alprazolam use was minimal, limited to one dose per week during stressful situations. At the three-month follow-up, she continued to demonstrate marked symptom improvement and resumed full functionality in her daily life."
