"A 19-year-old male presented with a 7-day history of fever, sore throat, and progressive fatigue. He reported painful swallowing, loss of appetite, and mild abdominal discomfort during this period. There was no history of cough, rhinorrhea, or recent travel. He denied any use of medications or illicit substances. His medical history was unremarkable, and he had no known allergies. Family and social history were non-contributory.
On physical examination, the patient appeared fatigued but was alert and oriented. His vital signs revealed a temperature of 39°C, heart rate of 96 bpm, and blood pressure of 118/76 mmHg. Cervical lymphadenopathy was noted, with enlarged, tender lymph nodes bilaterally in the anterior and posterior chains. Examination of the oropharynx revealed erythema, marked tonsillar enlargement, and exudates. Mild splenomegaly was detected on abdominal palpation, but there was no hepatomegaly or noticeable rash.
Initial laboratory evaluation showed the following: WBC, 12,000/μL, with 65% lymphocytes and 15% atypical lymphocytes. Hgb and PLT were normal. CRP was mildly elevated. Liver function tests revealed transaminitis, with ALT at 125 U/L and AST at 98 U/L. Kidney function and electrolytes were within normal limits. A rapid strep test was negative, as were throat and blood cultures. Serologic testing for EBV demonstrated positive IgM antibodies to the viral capsid antigen (VCA) and negative EBNA antibodies, confirming acute primary EBV infection. Testing for CMV IgM was negative.
The clinical and laboratory findings were consistent with a diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis. Supportive care was initiated, which included advising rest, adequate hydration, and symptomatic management with acetaminophen 650 mg every 6 hours as needed for fever and discomfort. Given the presence of splenomegaly, the patient was cautioned to avoid contact sports or strenuous physical activity for at least 4 weeks to reduce the risk of splenic rupture. 
Over the next week, his fever decreased, and his sore throat improved. By the second week, his fatigue had begun to resolve, and follow-up demonstrated improvement in lymphadenopathy. Liver function tests normalized over a subsequent one-month period. The patient experienced full recovery within 6 weeks, with no complications."
