"A 32-year-old female presented with a chief complaint of persistent fatigue, dizziness, and shortness of breath over the past 2 months. She reported a gradual onset of symptoms, with worsening over the preceding weeks. She described a general sense of weakness, particularly after minimal exertion, and noted episodes of lightheadedness when standing or walking. She denied chest pain, palpitations, or syncope. Her medical history was significant for menorrhagia over several years, for which she had not sought medical attention. She denied a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, dietary restrictions, recent infections, or significant weight loss. She reported no use of medications or supplements. There was no family history of blood disorders or chronic illnesses.
On physical exam, she appeared pale and fatigued but was in no acute distress. Her vital signs were within normal limits except for a borderline tachycardia. Conjunctival pallor and dry skin were noted. Cardiovascular exam showed no murmurs or gallops. Her respiratory exam was normal, with clear breath sounds bilaterally. Her abdomen was soft and non-tender, with no organomegaly. There was no evidence of peripheral edema, cyanosis, or nail changes such as koilonychia. Neurological examination, including muscle strength testing, was unremarkable.
Laboratory evaluation revealed Hb of 8.4 g/dL and Hct of 26.5%. MCV was 69.2 fL, consistent with microcytosis, and MCH was 21.5 pg, indicative of hypochromia. Peripheral blood smear demonstrated anisocytosis and marked poikilocytosis with microcytes. Serum ferritin was 6 ng/mL, and transferrin saturation was decreased at 11%. Serum iron was 28 µg/dL, with a TIBC of 480 µg/dL, confirming iron deficiency. Other lab results, including serum B12 and folate levels, were within normal limits. Reticulocyte count was normal. Stool occult blood testing was negative, and no evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding was identified.
The patient was diagnosed with IDA secondary to chronic blood loss due to menorrhagia. Given her Hb level and clinical symptoms, oral iron therapy was initiated. She was prescribed ferrous sulfate 325 mg PO TID. Dietary counseling was provided to ensure adequate intake of iron-rich foods. She was referred to a gynecologist for evaluation and management of her menorrhagia to address the underlying cause of her anemia.
At the 4-week follow-up, the patient reported significant improvement in energy levels and resolution of dizziness and dyspnea. Repeat labs showed an increase in Hb to 10.2 g/dL and a rising reticulocyte count, consistent with a positive response to treatment. Management of her menorrhagia was ongoing, with plans for further evaluation and potential hormonal therapy. She was advised to continue oral iron supplementation for at least 3 months after normalization of Hb to replenish iron stores."
