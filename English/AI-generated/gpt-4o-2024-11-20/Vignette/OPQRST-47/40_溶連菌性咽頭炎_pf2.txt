"An 8-year-old female with no significant past medical history presented with a chief complaint of sore throat, fever, and lymphadenopathy. The symptoms began 3 days prior to presentation with a sudden onset of throat pain that worsened with swallowing. The fever had been persistent, peaking at 39.0°C. No cough, rhinorrhea, or gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea or vomiting were reported. The patient’s parents also denied any recent sick contacts or travel history.
On physical examination, the patient appeared moderately ill but was alert and oriented. Vital signs showed a temperature of 38.8°C, HR 110 bpm, BP 100/65 mmHg, and RR 16/min. Inspection of the oropharynx revealed erythematous and swollen tonsils with white exudates bilaterally. Petechiae were noted on the soft palate. There was significant tenderness and swelling in the bilateral anterior cervical lymph nodes, with the largest measuring approximately 2 cm in diameter. Lung and cardiovascular exams were unremarkable. No maculopapular rash or desquamation was observed on her skin. Abdominal examination did not reveal hepatosplenomegaly.
A throat swab for rapid antigen detection testing (RADT) for Group A Streptococcus (GAS) was performed and yielded a positive result. CBC demonstrated leukocytosis with WBC 14,500/μL, neutrophil predominance of 82%, and lymphocytes at 12%. CRP was elevated at 20 mg/L. LFTs and renal function tests were within normal limits. A throat culture was also obtained for confirmation, though the results would take 24-48 hours.
Based on the clinical presentation and positive RADT, the diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis caused by GAS was made. The patient was started on oral amoxicillin at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day divided every 12 hours, for a total of 10 days. The prescribed dose for this patient, weighing approximately 25 kg, was 625 mg divided into two doses of 312.5 mg per dose. The patient had no known drug allergies, and the family was instructed on the importance of completing the course of antibiotics to prevent complications such as rheumatic fever or post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. Symptomatic management included acetaminophen (15 mg/kg per dose) for fever and pain relief, which was administered as needed.
The patient showed clinical improvement within 48 hours of initiating treatment. Fever resolved by the second day of antibiotics, and throat pain significantly subsided by the fourth day. Follow-up revealed complete resolution of symptoms at 10 days, with no development of complications or adverse medication reactions."
