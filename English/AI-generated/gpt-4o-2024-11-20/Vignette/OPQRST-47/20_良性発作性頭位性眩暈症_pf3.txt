"A 60-year-old male presented with a primary complaint of episodic vertigo that occurred when he moved his head, particularly when looking upward or turning over in bed. The symptoms had been present for two weeks prior to his visit and were described as brief, lasting less than a minute each time. He reported that closing his eyes alleviated the sensation of vertigo, and he denied any associated hearing loss, nausea, vomiting, or neurological deficits. His medical history was significant for intermittent tinnitus but unremarkable for other otologic, neurological, or cardiovascular conditions.
On physical examination, the patient appeared alert and was oriented to time, place, and person. His vital signs were within normal limits. Otoscopic examination revealed no abnormalities of the external auditory canal or tympanic membrane. Neurological examination, including cranial nerve assessment, strength, and reflexes, was normal. A specialized positional maneuver, the Dix-Hallpike test, was performed and elicited vertigo and a characteristic upbeat-torsional nystagmus when positioning the patient rapidly from sitting to lying with his head turned 45 degrees to the right. The symptoms subsided within 20 seconds upon maintaining the position and did not recur with subsequent testing of the same side. The findings were less pronounced when the test was performed on the left side. No signs of central nervous system involvement, such as gaze-evoked nystagmus, limb ataxia, or dysarthria, were observed during the examination.
Audiometric testing was conducted and showed normal thresholds for both air and bone conduction, with no asymmetry between the ears. Imaging studies, including an MRI of the brain, were ordered to rule out central causes of vertigo such as posterior circulation stroke or cerebellar lesions. The MRI was unremarkable, with no evidence of structural abnormalities. Based on the patient's presenting symptoms, the findings on the Dix-Hallpike test, and the exclusion of central causes, the diagnosis of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), specifically involving the right posterior semicircular canal, was confirmed.
The patient was treated with the canalith repositioning procedure (Epley maneuver), performed at the bedside. He tolerated the procedure well, and upon re-evaluation shortly afterward, his vertigo and nystagmus were significantly diminished. In addition to the maneuver, he was prescribed a short, three-day course of meclizine at a dose of 25 mg orally twice daily to manage any residual dizziness. He was advised to avoid lying flat or rapidly moving his head for 24 hours following the procedure and was instructed on postural precautions. Follow-up one week later revealed complete resolution of symptoms, and no additional interventions were required."
