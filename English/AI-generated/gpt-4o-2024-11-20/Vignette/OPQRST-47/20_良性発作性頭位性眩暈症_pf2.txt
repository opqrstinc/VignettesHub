"A 48-year-old female presented with complaints of sudden episodes of dizziness lasting several seconds, primarily triggered by positional changes such as rolling over in bed or standing up abruptly. She reported the symptoms started two weeks prior to presentation and described the dizziness as a sensation of spinning. The episodes were not associated with tinnitus, hearing loss, or aural fullness. She also denied headaches, nausea, vomiting, or recent upper respiratory tract infections. Her medical history was significant for migraine, but she reported no changes in her usual headache pattern or frequency.
On physical examination, vital signs were within normal limits. Neurological examination revealed no focal deficits. The Dix-Hallpike maneuver was performed, which elicited a brief burst of nystagmus and reproduction of the vertiginous symptoms when the patientâ€™s head was turned toward the right side and extended below the horizontal plane. The nystagmus was torsional and upbeat, supporting the suspicion of posterior canal BPPV. No abnormalities were detected on otoscopic examination, and other physical findings were unremarkable.
Additional diagnostic testing included non-contrast MRI of the brain to rule out central causes of vertigo, given her history of migraine. The imaging study was normal, with no evidence of vascular abnormalities, masses, or demyelinating lesions. Audiologic testing showed no sign of sensorineural hearing loss, further excluding Meniere's disease or vestibular schwannoma. Given the rapid resolution of symptoms after positional changes, a low clinical suspicion for central pathology, and characteristic findings on the Dix-Hallpike test, a diagnosis of BPPV involving the right posterior semicircular canal was made.
Management began with canalith repositioning maneuvers, specifically the Epley maneuver, performed in the office. These maneuvers were repeated during follow-up over the subsequent week as her symptoms persisted intermittently. She was also instructed to perform modified home-based Brandt-Daroff exercises to facilitate otolith repositioning. Pharmacological treatment was not initiated as her symptoms were episodic, transient, and clearly linked to positional changes. Symptom education and reassurance were provided, emphasizing the benign and self-limited nature of the condition.
At a follow-up visit two weeks after the initial diagnosis, the patient reported significant improvement. She experienced no further episodes of vertigo during positional changes and was able to return to her daily activities without limitations. She expressed understanding of the condition and was advised to seek care promptly if symptoms recurred, particularly if associated with persistent nystagmus, hearing changes, or neurological deficits. No pharmacological agents, such as meclizine or diazepam, were prescribed during the treatment course due to the absence of severe or intractable symptoms."
