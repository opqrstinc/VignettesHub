"A 20-year-old female presented with a 2-day history of acute-onset chest pain, progressive dyspnea, and fever. The chest pain was described as pleuritic, non-radiating, and worsened with deep inspiration. Dyspnea progressed from mild exertional symptoms to occurring at rest. She denied any prior similar episodes, chronic respiratory symptoms, or significant medical history. She was a nonsmoker with no known environmental or occupational exposures, and there was no recent travel or infectious contact. No personal or family history of atopic or autoimmune disease was reported. Over-the-counter antipyretics provided little relief.
On initial examination, her temperature was 38.5°C, HR was 110 bpm, BP was 120/78 mmHg, RR was 28/min, and SpO2 was 88% on room air. There was no pallor, cyanosis, or peripheral edema. Lung auscultation revealed diffuse crackles bilaterally without wheezes. No skin rashes, joint swelling, or mucosal lesions were noted, and cardiovascular, abdominal, and neurological examinations were otherwise unremarkable.
Laboratory workup showed WBC count of 11.8 × 10^3/μL with a marked eosinophilia of 4.2 × 10^3/μL. CRP and ESR were elevated, consistent with inflammation. ABG on room air revealed hypoxemia with PaO2 of 62 mmHg and respiratory alkalosis (pH 7.48). A CXR revealed bilateral diffuse reticulonodular opacities, predominantly in the mid-to-lower lung zones. HRCT of the chest showed bilateral patchy ground-glass opacities without evidence of consolidation, fibrosis, or pleural effusion. The findings were consistent with acute lung injury patterns. Sputum cultures, Gram staining, and fungal and mycobacterial tests were negative. Bronchoscopy with BAL revealed increased eosinophils (>25% of total cells) and sterile cultures. Testing for parasitic infections, ANCA, and serum IgE levels yielded no abnormalities.
Based on the clinical presentation, imaging findings, eosinophilic predominance in BAL, and the exclusion of infectious, autoimmune, and parasitic causes, she was diagnosed with acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP). 
Treatment was initiated with methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg/day IV initially. Rapid improvement in symptoms, oxygenation, and inflammatory markers was observed within 48 hours. SpO2 normalized to 96% on room air by day 3. She was transitioned to oral prednisone 40 mg/day with a gradual taper over 4 weeks. Repeat HRCT at 1 month showed complete resolution of pulmonary infiltrates, and follow-up blood work demonstrated normalization of eosinophil count. No recurrence was observed during follow-up."
