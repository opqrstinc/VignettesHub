"A 62-year-old female presented with a chief complaint of right upper quadrant abdominal pain that had progressively worsened over a period of 24 hours. The pain was described as sharp and constant, radiating to the right scapular region. She also reported associated symptoms of nausea and fever with a maximum recorded temperature of 38.5°C. Her past medical history was significant for known cholelithiasis, diagnosed via abdominal US two years prior, though she had been asymptomatic until the current presentation. She denied jaundice, changes in stool, or pruritus.
On physical examination, the patient appeared febrile and mildly distressed due to the severity of the pain. Her vital signs included a temperature of 38.2°C, HR of 102/min, BP of 128/84 mmHg, and RR of 18/min. Abdominal examination revealed tenderness localized to the right upper quadrant with guarding upon palpation. Murphy's sign was positive. No scleral icterus or skin changes consistent with jaundice were noted. Cardiopulmonary and neurological examinations were unremarkable.
Laboratory tests revealed leukocytosis with a WBC count of 14,200/μL and neutrophilic predominance. CRP was elevated at 105 mg/L. Liver function tests showed mildly elevated AST and ALT levels at 45 and 56 U/L, respectively. Serum total bilirubin was within normal limits at 0.8 mg/dL. ALP was mildly elevated at 150 U/L. Amylase and lipase levels were within normal ranges, ruling out pancreatitis. Blood cultures were obtained. Abdominal US demonstrated gallbladder wall thickening (>4 mm), the presence of pericholecystic fluid, and gallstones within the lumen. No evidence of biliary ductal dilatation or choledocholithiasis was observed. HIDA scan was not performed as US findings were conclusive.
Based on the clinical presentation, imaging findings, and laboratory results, a diagnosis of acute calculous cholecystitis was made. Broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy was initiated to cover gram-negative and anaerobic organisms. The patient received an IV dose of piperacillin-tazobactam at 4.5 g every 6 hours. Supportive care including IV fluids and analgesia with acetaminophen 1 g every 6 hours was provided.
After 48 hours of antibiotic treatment, the patient's symptoms showed partial improvement, with a reduction in her abdominal pain and fever. Surgical consultation was obtained, and laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed on hospital day 3 without complications. Intraoperative findings confirmed an inflamed, thickened gallbladder with multiple stones and no evidence of perforation or gangrene. Cultures from bile samples grew Escherichia coli, confirming the presence of infection. Postoperative recovery was uneventful, and she was discharged home on postoperative day 2. Oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily and metronidazole 500 mg twice daily were prescribed for 5 days to complete a 7-day antibiotic course. Follow-up one week after discharge revealed complete resolution of her symptoms, and she reported no adverse effects from the medications."
