"A 30-year-old female presented to the ED with complaints of headache, fatigue, and nausea that began approximately five hours prior to arrival. She reported that she had been performing outdoor physical activities under direct sunlight for several hours in a hot and humid environment with no access to shade or adequate hydration. She denied any prior similar episodes, chronic medical conditions, or recent illnesses. Her intake of fluids during the activity had been minimal, and she reported multiple episodes of vomiting after the onset of symptoms.
On physical examination, her core body temperature was 39.8Â°C. She appeared distressed, flushed, and diaphoretic. There was no evidence of trauma, and her neurological evaluation revealed no focal deficits. BP was 90/55 mmHg, HR was 132 bpm, and RR was 24/min. Sclerae and mucous membranes were dry, indicative of dehydration. Skin turgor was decreased. No rashes or petechiae were observed. Peripheral pulses were weak and thready. Cardiovascular and pulmonary auscultation showed no abnormalities.
Initial laboratory studies included an elevated WBC count with a mild left shift. Hct was elevated, suggestive of hemoconcentration. Electrolyte analysis showed Na of 149 mEq/L, K of 3.1 mEq/L, and Cl of 113 mEq/L, consistent with dehydration and possible electrolyte imbalances. BUN and Cr were elevated, with a BUN/Cr ratio of >20:1, supporting a prerenal state. LFTs showed mildly elevated AST and ALT levels. ABG revealed mild metabolic acidosis with elevated lactate (2.8 mmol/L), indicating likely tissue hypoperfusion. UA was positive for concentrated urine with no evidence of infection. An ECG revealed sinus tachycardia without ischemic changes.
The patient was diagnosed with heat stroke, characterized by hyperthermia due to environmental heat exposure, alongside clinical signs of dehydration and systemic involvement.
She was immediately moved to a cooled environment, and active cooling methods were initiated, including cold water baths and the application of ice packs to the axillae and groin. IV fluid resuscitation was initiated with 1 L of isotonic saline over the first hour, followed by maintenance fluids adjusted to urine output and serum electrolyte levels. Ondansetron 4 mg IV every eight hours as needed was administered to control nausea. Potassium levels were corrected with IV potassium chloride at a dose of 20 mEq/L over two hours under continuous ECG monitoring.
Her body temperature normalized within two hours, her HR decreased to 88 bpm, and BP stabilized at 110/70 mmHg after fluid resuscitation. Electrolyte disturbances resolved within 12 hours of management. She continued to demonstrate clinical improvement and was monitored for an additional 24 hours without further complications. She was discharged with instructions to avoid prolonged heat exposure, hydrate adequately, and seek medical attention promptly if symptoms recurred."
