"A 62-year-old female presented with intermittent, severe, stabbing pain localized to the left side of her face, primarily affecting the cheek and mandibular region. The episodes began approximately two months before presentation and occurred several times daily. The pain was sharp, lancinating, and lasted a few seconds to a couple of minutes. Episodes were often triggered by mild stimuli such as brushing her teeth, chewing, or light touch to the face. She reported no associated sensory loss, numbness, or weakness. There was no history of similar episodes in the past, and she had no relevant medical or surgical history. She denied any recent trauma, infections, fever, or weight loss.
Physical examination revealed no apparent abnormalities. Neurological assessment demonstrated no motor deficits, no sensory impairment, and no cranial nerve abnormalities. Light palpation over the left V2 (maxillary) and V3 (mandibular) dermatomes elicited pain, consistent with her primary complaint. There were no signs of inflammation, swelling, or tenderness elsewhere on the face or jaw.
MRI of the brain with and without contrast was performed to exclude intracranial structural abnormalities. The scan demonstrated no masses, demyelinating lesions, or ischemic changes. There was evidence of vascular compression of the left trigeminal nerve root by a looping superior cerebellar artery near the pons. No other significant findings were observed. Routine laboratory tests were unremarkable, including CBC, CMP, and inflammatory markers. No evidence of systemic conditions such as autoimmune disease, infection, or malignancy was found.
The clinical presentation, physical findings, and imaging results were consistent with a diagnosis of classic trigeminal neuralgia (TN), also known as idiopathic TN. The vascular compression seen on imaging further supported the diagnosis.
Carbamazepine was initiated as first-line therapy at a starting dose of 100 mg twice daily. The dose was gradually titrated to 200 mg twice daily, as tolerated, to achieve adequate symptom control. The patient reported a significant reduction in the frequency and intensity of pain episodes within one week of initiating therapy. Over subsequent follow-ups, no adverse effects, including dizziness or nausea, were reported with carbamazepine usage.
The patient was advised to continue regular follow-up for monitoring therapeutic response and potential side effects. Surgical options such as microvascular decompression or ablative procedures were discussed for potential future consideration if symptoms became refractory to medical therapy. However, at the time, pharmacologic management with carbamazepine effectively controlled the symptoms."
