"A 62-year-old male presented with a chief complaint of progressive low back pain and bilateral lower extremity numbness. He reported that his symptoms had gradually worsened over the past six months. The pain was exacerbated by prolonged standing and walking, limiting his ability to walk more than 50 meters before experiencing significant discomfort and numbness, primarily in the posterior thighs and calves. He described relief of symptoms upon sitting or leaning forward. He denied any history of trauma, fever, bowel or bladder dysfunction, or recent infections. There was no significant past medical history.
On physical examination, his vital signs were within normal limits. Inspection of the lumbar spine showed no visible deformities. Palpation revealed tenderness along the lumbar paravertebral muscles. Neurological examination identified decreased sensation to light touch and pinprick in an L5-S1 distribution bilaterally. Muscle strength testing revealed slight weakness (4/5) in the ankle dorsiflexors bilaterally. Deep tendon reflexes were diminished at the patellar and Achilles tendons on both sides. The straight leg raise test was negative bilaterally, and gait assessment demonstrated mild antalgia with a forward flexed posture. Peripheral pulses were normal in both lower extremities.
MRI of the lumbar spine showed significant narrowing of the spinal canal at the L4-L5 level, with thickening of the ligamentum flavum and mild disc bulging contributing to the stenosis. T2-weighted images demonstrated compression of the thecal sac and impingement of bilateral L5 nerve roots within the central canal. X-rays of the lumbar spine revealed degenerative spondylosis and mild grade I spondylolisthesis at L4-L5. Routine blood work, including CBC, CRP, and ESR, was within normal limits.
The patient was diagnosed with lumbar spinal stenosis, most prominently at the L4-L5 level, based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings.
Initial treatment included physical therapy focused on core strengthening and lumbar flexion exercises. Oral acetaminophen (500 mg every 6 hours as needed) and an NSAID, meloxicam (15 mg once daily), were prescribed for pain management. After three months with no significant improvement, the patient received an ESI with 40 mg of triamcinolone. Symptoms improved moderately for four weeks following the injection, but the relief was not sustained. Due to persistent functional impairment, surgical intervention was pursued. A decompressive laminectomy at L4-L5 was performed without fusion. Postoperatively, he reported significant improvement in symptoms, with resolution of radicular pain and numbness. Six months following surgery, he remained active with mild residual low back discomfort managed with occasional use of acetaminophen."
