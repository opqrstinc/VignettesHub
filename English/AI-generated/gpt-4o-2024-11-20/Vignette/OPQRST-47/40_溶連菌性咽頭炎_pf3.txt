"A 23-year-old male presented with a 3-day history of sore throat, fever, and general malaise. He reported the onset of symptoms as sudden, with no preceding rhinorrhea, cough, or other upper respiratory tract symptoms. The pain in the throat was characterized as severe and aggravated by swallowing. He also noted fatigue and reduced appetite. There was no history of exposure to known infectious contacts or recent travel. His medical history was unremarkable, and he reported no prior episodes of similar symptoms. He was not taking any medications and denied allergies to food, medications, or environmental factors.
On physical examination, his temperature was 38.9°C, HR was 96 bpm, and BP was 120/78 mmHg. His oropharyngeal region appeared erythematous with swollen, erythematous tonsils that exhibited a whitish exudate bilaterally. Bilateral tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy was noted, while no posterior cervical or supraclavicular nodes were palpable. The uvula was midline without deviation, and no notable signs of upper respiratory or lower respiratory tract involvement were observed. His lungs were clear to auscultation. Skin examination revealed no rash or petechiae.
Laboratory investigations revealed an elevated WBC count of 14,200/μL with 85% neutrophils. CRP was elevated at 3.2 mg/dL. No significant abnormalities were detected in renal or liver function tests. The rapid antigen detection test (RADT) for group A Streptococcus (GAS) was positive. A throat culture was also obtained, but results were pending at the time of diagnosis.
The clinical presentation, including the patient’s sudden onset of sore throat, fever, anterior cervical lymphadenopathy, tonsillar exudates, and a positive RADT, confirmed the diagnosis of GAS pharyngitis.
Treatment was initiated with oral penicillin V potassium 500 mg administered every 8 hours for a total duration of 10 days. The patient was instructed to complete the full course of antibiotics and to monitor for adverse effects such as rash or gastrointestinal discomfort. Supportive care included hydration and the use of acetaminophen 500 mg every 6 hours as needed for fever and throat discomfort.
At the 48-hour follow-up, the patient demonstrated marked clinical improvement with fever resolution and significant reduction in throat pain. He reported better energy levels and resumed eating without difficulty. The throat culture later confirmed the presence of GAS, corroborating the initial clinical and laboratory findings. No treatment-associated adverse effects were reported during the subsequent visits, and the patient completed the remainder of the antibiotic regimen without complications. By the end of the treatment course, he returned to baseline health without residual symptoms."
