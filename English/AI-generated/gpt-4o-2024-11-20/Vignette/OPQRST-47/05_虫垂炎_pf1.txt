"A 35-year-old female presented with a chief complaint of right lower abdominal pain and associated nausea, which had progressively worsened over the past 24 hours. The pain initially began near the umbilical region and later localized to the right lower quadrant (RLQ). She described the pain as sharp and constant, with no alleviating or aggravating factors. She denied any recent fever, vomiting, changes in bowel habits, or urinary symptoms. Her medical, surgical, and family histories were unremarkable, and she had no known drug allergies. 
On physical examination, her vital signs revealed a mild fever of 37.8°C, HR of 98 bpm, BP of 120/75 mmHg, RR of 18 breaths per minute, and SpO2 of 99% on room air. Abdominal examination demonstrated tenderness in the RLQ with guarding and rebound tenderness. The McBurney point was notably tender. Rovsing’s sign and the obturator sign were positive. There was no evidence of jaundice, abnormal bowel sounds, or palpable masses. The remainder of the physical exam was unremarkable.
Laboratory investigations revealed a WBC count of 14,200/μL with a left shift in neutrophils, indicating leukocytosis. CRP was elevated at 6.5 mg/L. Serum electrolytes, renal function tests, and LFTs were within normal limits. Urinalysis showed no evidence of UTI or hematuria. A serum pregnancy test was negative. Imaging studies, including abdominal ultrasonography, revealed an enlarged and non-compressible tubular structure in the RLQ with a diameter of 8.5 mm, consistent with an inflamed appendix. CT of the abdomen with IV contrast confirmed an enlarged appendix with wall thickening, surrounding fat stranding, and no signs of perforation or abscess formation.
The patient was diagnosed with acute uncomplicated appendicitis. She was admitted for appendectomy and perioperative management. Prior to surgery, she received IV fluids (0.9% sodium chloride) for hydration and a single preoperative dose of ceftriaxone 2 g IV combined with metronidazole 500 mg IV for prophylaxis against surgical site infection. Laparoscopic appendectomy was performed without complications. Intraoperative findings included an inflamed but intact appendix with no significant adhesions or purulent collections.
Postoperatively, she was continued on IV ceftriaxone 2 g daily and metronidazole 500 mg every 8 hours for 24 hours. Pain was managed with IV acetaminophen 1 g every 6 hours as needed and oral ibuprofen 400 mg every 8 hours. She was encouraged to ambulate early and tolerated a clear liquid diet on postoperative day 1, progressing to a regular diet by day 2. Her WBC count decreased to 9,000/μL, and her symptoms, including RLQ pain and nausea, resolved completely. She was discharged on postoperative day 2 with a 5-day prescription for oral amoxicillin-clavulanate 875 mg/125 mg twice daily for infection prophylaxis. At a follow-up visit one week postoperatively, her recovery was uneventful, and she reported no complications or lingering symptoms."
