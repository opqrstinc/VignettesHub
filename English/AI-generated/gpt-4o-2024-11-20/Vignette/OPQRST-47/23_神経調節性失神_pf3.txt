"A 12-year-old female presented to the clinic with complaints of recurrent episodes of syncope, associated with palpitations and nausea. According to her mother, these episodes began approximately two months prior, with the most recent one occurring two days before presentation. Episodes were typically triggered by prolonged standing during school assembly or by emotional stress, such as anxiety before an exam. Each episode was preceded by dizziness and worsening palpitations, followed by a brief loss of consciousness lasting less than a minute. Recovery was prompt, and she did not experience post-ictal confusion or tongue biting. She reported no chest pain, dyspnea, or other symptoms suggestive of cardiac or pulmonary conditions. She denied any recent illnesses, trauma, or heat exposure. Her past medical history was unremarkable, with no known cardiac conditions or other underlying diseases. Her family history was negative for sudden cardiac death or arrhythmias.
On physical examination, she appeared well-nourished and appropriately developed for her age. Her BP was 102/68 mmHg while lying and decreased to 85/62 mmHg upon standing, accompanied by mild dizziness. HR was 75 bpm in the supine position and increased to 118 bpm upon standing. No orthostatic hypotension or sustained tachycardia was evident. Cardiovascular examination revealed normal heart sounds with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Respiratory examination showed clear breath sounds bilaterally without evidence of wheezing or crackles. Neurological evaluation, including cranial nerve and motor assessments, was normal. There were no signs of dehydration, pallor, or cyanosis. Ear, nose, and throat, as well as abdominal examinations, were unremarkable.
Initial diagnostic workup included a 12-lead ECG, which demonstrated normal sinus rhythm with no arrhythmias, prolonged QT interval, or structural abnormalities. Laboratory tests, including CBC, serum electrolytes, glucose, and TSH, were within normal limits. Echocardiography showed no evidence of structural cardiac anomalies, valvular dysfunction, or intracardiac thrombi. A 24-hour Holter monitoring test did not reveal any episodes of bradyarrhythmia, tachycardia, or ventricular ectopy. A tilt-table test was performed and reproduced her symptoms, including dizziness and transient syncope, in association with a marked drop in BP and a relative bradycardic response during the tilt phase. These findings were consistent with a diagnosis of neurally mediated syncope (vasovagal syncope).
The patient was counseled on non-pharmacological management strategies, including maintaining adequate hydration with at least 2 liters of fluid daily and increasing dietary salt intake to approximately 6 grams per day. She was instructed to avoid prolonged standing and to recognize prodromal symptoms, such as dizziness, so that she could adopt physical counter-maneuvers like leg-crossing and squatting to abort impending episodes. Educational materials were provided to both the patient and her family to ensure compliance and understanding of these preventive measures. Pharmacological therapy was initiated due to the frequency of symptoms and their impact on her quality of life. She was started on oral midodrine at a dose of 2.5 mg three times daily, titrated to 5 mg three times daily based on symptom response, with instructions to take the last dose at least 4 hours before bedtime to reduce the risk of supine hypertension. Follow-up was scheduled after one month.
At her one-month follow-up, the patient reported a noticeable reduction in the frequency and severity of syncopal episodes. She adhered to hydration and dietary recommendations and tolerated midodrine without adverse effects. Repeat monitoring of BP and HR showed improved orthostatic stability. She was encouraged to continue her current management plan and was advised to return for further evaluation if symptoms recurred or worsened."
