"A 55-year-old male presented with a 3-day history of chest discomfort characterized as a pressing sensation localized to the anterior chest. He described the pain as non-radiating, exacerbated by lying supine, and partially relieved when sitting upright or leaning forward. He also reported dyspnea on exertion and intermittent low-grade fever since symptom onset. There was no history of recent trauma, upper respiratory infection, or significant physical exertion preceding symptoms. His medical history included controlled hypertension managed with amlodipine, with no other known comorbidities. He denied any recent infections, surgeries, or known exposure to sick contacts.
On physical examination, the patient appeared mildly distressed but hemodynamically stable, with a BP of 135/85 mmHg, HR of 92 bpm, and body temperature of 38.1°C. Respiratory rate was 20/min, and oxygen saturation was 97% on room air. Auscultation of the chest revealed normal lung sounds but a pericardial friction rub best appreciated at the left lower sternal border. There was no jugular venous distension or peripheral edema. Cardiopulmonary examination was otherwise unremarkable, and the remaining systemic examination did not yield any significant abnormalities.
Initial laboratory workup revealed an elevated WBC count of 13,200/μL with neutrophilic predominance, a CRP level of 18 mg/dL, and ESR of 55 mm/hr. Serum troponin levels were mildly elevated at 0.09 ng/mL, while the CK-MB level was within normal limits. Renal and liver function tests were unremarkable, and electrolyte levels were within normal ranges. ECG demonstrated diffuse ST-segment elevation in multiple leads (I, II, aVL, and V2–V6) with PR segment depression, with no evidence of reciprocal changes. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed a small-to-moderate pericardial effusion without echocardiographic signs of tamponade and preserved left ventricular systolic function. Chest X-ray was unremarkable with no signs of pulmonary edema or pleural effusion.
The clinical presentation, supported by findings on physical examination, ECG, inflammatory markers, and echocardiography, confirmed the diagnosis of acute pericarditis. Given the absence of hemodynamic compromise and significant pericardial effusion, the case was classified as idiopathic, likely viral in etiology, as no other secondary causes were evident.
Treatment was initiated with oral ibuprofen 600 mg every 8 hours, combined with colchicine 0.5 mg twice daily for a planned duration of 3 months. Gastric protection was ensured with oral omeprazole 20 mg daily. Amlodipine was continued at the patient’s usual dose for blood pressure control, given the absence of contraindications. The patient was advised to avoid strenuous physical activity for at least 3 months, and hydration status was carefully monitored. Serial follow-ups were scheduled to assess symptom resolution and monitor the inflammatory markers, pericardial effusion size, and medication tolerability.
Within one week, the patient reported significant improvement in chest discomfort and resolution of dyspnea. His temperature normalized, and inflammatory markers (CRP and ESR) showed marked reductions. By one month, repeat ECG demonstrated resolution of ST-segment elevations, and echocardiography revealed only a trivial pericardial effusion. At the 3-month follow-up, he remained symptom-free, inflammatory markers were within normal limits, and colchicine was successfully discontinued."
