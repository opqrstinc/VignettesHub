"A 55-year-old male presented with complaints of reduced concentration and persistent fatigue that had been ongoing for the past 6 months. He reported difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep, with frequent awakenings during the night. His sleep disturbances occurred at least 4 nights per week and were associated with non-restorative sleep. He denied nightmares, sleepwalking, or other parasomnias. Despite feeling fatigued, he mentioned experiencing increased irritability and reduced motivation, which affected his ability to perform daily tasks and work efficiently. He denied significant psychological stress or major life changes at the time of symptom onset. There was no history of trauma, substance abuse, or use of sleep-altering medications. He reported no prior diagnosis of psychiatric illnesses, such as depression or anxiety, and he denied symptoms such as anhedonia or feelings of worthlessness.
On physical examination, his BMI was 24, and there were no apparent abnormalities in vital signs. His cardiovascular, respiratory, and neurological examinations were within normal limits, and no remarkable findings were observed in the HEENT, abdomen, or extremities. No signs of chronic disease, overt psychiatric disorders, or physical conditions likely to interfere with sleep were detected during the assessment.
Laboratory investigations revealed no remarkable abnormalities. CBC showed a WBC of 6.1 × 10³/μL, Hgb of 14.8 g/dL, and PLT of 230 × 10³/μL, all within normal ranges. CMP revealed normal levels of glucose, electrolytes, liver enzymes, and renal function markers. TSH was 2.3 μIU/mL, within normal limits, ruling out hypothyroidism as a potential cause of his fatigue and sleep disturbances. Serum ferritin and vitamin B12 levels were adequate, and polysomnography demonstrated preserved sleep architecture without sleep apnea or periodic limb movement disorder. His Epworth Sleepiness Scale score was 8, indicating mild daytime sleepiness. Screening for mood disorders, including PHQ-9 and GAD-7, revealed no significant scores suggestive of major depressive disorder or generalized anxiety disorder.
Based on the above findings, a diagnosis of chronic insomnia disorder was made. His symptoms fulfilled the criteria outlined in the DSM-5, including difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep, dissatisfaction with sleep quality despite adequate opportunities for sleep, and associated daytime impairment in concentration and functioning.
The patient was initially counseled on good sleep hygiene practices, including maintaining a consistent sleep schedule, creating a comfortable sleep environment, limiting caffeine and alcohol intake, and reducing screen time before bedtime. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) was initiated once a week for 8 weeks, focusing on psychoeducation, stimulus control, sleep restriction, and cognitive restructuring.
Pharmacological therapy was introduced due to significant impairment in daily function. He was prescribed zolpidem 10 mg to be taken orally at bedtime for short-term symptom relief. After 4 weeks, the dose was adjusted to 5 mg as his symptoms improved. Concurrently, he was started on ramelteon 8 mg orally 30 minutes before bedtime to help regulate his sleep-wake cycle. Both medications were well-tolerated, with no reported adverse effects, such as daytime sedation or dizziness. Regular follow-ups were conducted every 2 weeks.
After 3 months, the patient reported a noticeable improvement in sleep onset latency and sleep maintenance. He experienced reduced daytime fatigue and enhanced ability to concentrate on work tasks. At 6 months, his sleep patterns had normalized, and he was gradually weaned off zolpidem while continuing ramelteon to sustain long-term benefits."
