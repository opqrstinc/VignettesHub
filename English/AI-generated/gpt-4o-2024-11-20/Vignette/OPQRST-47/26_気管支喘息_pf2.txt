"A 16-year-old female presented with complaints of shortness of breath, persistent cough, and intermittent episodes of dyspnea over the past two weeks. Symptoms were most pronounced at night and exacerbated by physical activity, cold air exposure, and during the early hours of the morning. She described a sensation of chest tightness and audible wheezing, both of which had been recurring with increasing frequency. Her history revealed episodic wheezing and similar symptoms occurring over the preceding year, which were often associated with seasonal changes and exposure to airborne allergens. She reported no fever, weight loss, or prolonged fatigue. Her PMH included allergic rhinitis diagnosed in early childhood, but she had no prior diagnosis of asthma. She was not on any regular medications and denied any history of smoking, recent infections, or occupational exposures.
Physical exam revealed the patient to be in no acute distress but with mild tachypnea. Auscultation of the lungs demonstrated bilateral expiratory wheezing, most pronounced in the lower lung fields, while percussion revealed no abnormalities. Oxygen saturation on room air was 96% at rest. There were no signs of cyanosis or clubbing, and the heart sounds were normal. Examination of the nasal passages showed mild mucosal edema, consistent with allergic rhinitis, but no nasal polyps.
Spirometry revealed a reduced FEV1 at 68% of the predicted value, with an FEV1/FVC ratio below the lower limit of normal, confirming an obstructive ventilatory defect. Post-bronchodilator testing with albuterol (90 mcg, 2 puffs via metered-dose inhaler) showed a 15% increase in FEV1, meeting the criteria for reversible airway obstruction. CXR was unremarkable, with no evidence of consolidation, hyperinflation, or other structural abnormalities. Serum IgE levels were elevated, and allergen-specific skin-prick tests revealed positive reactions to dust mites and pollen. ABG was within normal limits, ruling out significant hypoxemia or hypercapnia.
The diagnosis of asthma was established based on the clinical presentation, history of atopy, physical findings, and spirometric evidence of reversible airway obstruction. The phenotype was identified as allergic asthma, given her sensitization to environmental allergens and concurrent allergic rhinitis.
The patient was initiated on a low-dose ICS, fluticasone propionate (100 mcg BID via inhalation), and a SABA, albuterol (90 mcg, 2 puffs PRN, up to every 4â€“6 hours, as needed for acute symptom relief). Education on inhaler technique was provided, and she was advised to avoid known triggers, including environmental allergens and cold air. A follow-up plan was arranged, including reassessment of asthma control in four weeks and regular monitoring of pulmonary function.
During follow-up, the patient reported significant improvement in symptoms, with no nocturnal awakenings or limitations in physical activity. Spirometry showed improved FEV1 at 82% of the predicted value. Adherence to therapy and trigger avoidance strategies were confirmed, with no reported side effects from the prescribed medications. The management plan was continued, with further consideration of stepping down therapy contingent on sustained symptom control over the subsequent months."
