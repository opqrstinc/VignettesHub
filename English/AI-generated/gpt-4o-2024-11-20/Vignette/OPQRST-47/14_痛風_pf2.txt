"A 42-year-old male presented with acute onset of severe pain and swelling in his right first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint for the past 24 hours. He reported that the pain initially began suddenly during the night, waking him from sleep, and progressively worsened, preventing him from walking. He denied prior episodes of similar joint pain but mentioned a history of nephrolithiasis diagnosed three years ago. He reported no recent trauma, fever, or systemic symptoms. He consumed alcohol occasionally, with a history of frequent red meat consumption. There was no family history of inflammatory arthritis or gout.
On physical examination, the patient exhibited marked erythema, warmth, and tenderness localized to the right first MTP joint, with associated significant swelling. The range of motion was severely restricted due to pain. No other joints were involved, and there were no tophi observed. The remainder of the physical exam, including cardiovascular, pulmonary, and abdominal systems, was unremarkable.
Laboratory investigations revealed serum uric acid (sUA) elevated at 9.6 mg/dL. Other findings included leukocytosis of 11,700/μL with neutrophilic predominance and a CRP level of 6.2 mg/dL. Additional metabolic panel values, including renal function, were within normal limits. Synovial fluid analysis from the right MTP joint demonstrated an elevated WBC count of 24,000/μL, predominantly neutrophils. Polarized light microscopy revealed negatively birefringent monosodium urate crystals, confirming the diagnosis of acute gouty arthritis. Gram stain and culture of the joint fluid showed no bacterial growth.
The patient was diagnosed with acute gouty arthritis involving the right first MTP joint. Colchicine at an initial dose of 1.2 mg followed by 0.6 mg one hour later was administered, with subsequent dosing of 0.6 mg twice daily for three days. Additionally, naproxen 500 mg twice daily was initiated for symptomatic relief, with plans to taper over one week. The patient was counseled to hydrate adequately and avoid alcohol, purine-rich foods, and excessive fructose intake. Allopurinol was not started during the acute attack; however, the need for urate-lowering therapy (ULT) was discussed for long-term management, considering his history of hyperuricemia and nephrolithiasis.
The patient reported significant pain relief within 48 hours and resolution of swelling and erythema by day five of treatment. Follow-up at two weeks confirmed complete resolution of symptoms, with discussion of initiating allopurinol at 100 mg daily and titrating based on sUA levels in the future. He was advised to follow up for regular monitoring of sUA and renal function while maintaining lifestyle modifications."
