"A 32-year-old male presented with a chief complaint of postprandial fullness and early satiety persisting for approximately 6 months. He reported that symptoms occurred intermittently after meals, regardless of the type or quantity of food consumed. The symptoms were non-progressive but significantly impacted his daily life, including reduced dietary intake and occasional mild nausea. There was no associated weight loss, vomiting, melena, or hematemesis. He had a history of well-controlled hypertension for which he was taking amlodipine 5 mg daily. There was no family history of GI disorders or malignancies, and he denied smoking, alcohol consumption, and use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. 
On physical examination, his vitals were stable, with a BMI of 24.3 kg/mÂ². Abdominal examination revealed no tenderness, guarding, or rebound. There were no palpable masses, organomegaly, or visible abdominal distension. No abnormalities were observed on cardiac, pulmonary, or neurologic examinations. 
Laboratory tests, including CBC, liver function tests, and pancreatic enzyme levels, were within normal limits. H. pylori Ag in the stool was negative. Upper endoscopy demonstrated normal esophageal, gastric, and duodenal mucosa without evidence of ulcers, inflammation, or masses. Biopsy samples taken from the gastric antrum and body revealed no histologic abnormalities. Abdominal ultrasound was unremarkable, with no signs of gallbladder disease or other structural abnormalities. Gastric emptying scintigraphy excluded delayed gastric emptying as symptoms resolved within the normal range. Serum glucose and TSH levels were normal, and screening for celiac disease serologies (tTG IgA) was negative. 
Based on Rome IV criteria, the patient was diagnosed with functional dyspepsia (postprandial distress syndrome subtype). 
He was initiated on omeprazole 20 mg once daily as a PPI trial and given dietary advice to eat smaller, more frequent meals and avoid identified trigger foods. Due to persistent symptoms after 4 weeks of PPI therapy, the treatment was adjusted to include the prokinetic agent metoclopramide at 10 mg three times daily, taken 30 minutes before meals. This combination treatment resulted in a gradual improvement of his symptoms over the subsequent 6 weeks. He experienced a significant reduction in postprandial fullness and early satiety, allowing a return to regular dietary patterns. 
At the 3-month follow-up, his symptoms were well-controlled on omeprazole 20 mg daily and metoclopramide 10 mg TID. Regular monitoring for potential adverse effects of long-term metoclopramide use was planned, with patient counseling regarding early symptom recognition of tardive dyskinesia. He was advised to continue dietary modifications and maintain follow-ups every 3 months to evaluate symptom control and medication tolerability."
