"A 71-year-old female presented with complaints of a persistent cough, production of sputum, and progressively worsening dyspnea over the past two years, with a notable exacerbation in the preceding two weeks. She reported difficulty performing daily activities due to breathlessness. The cough was predominantly productive with whitish sputum, and she denied any hemoptysis. She had a 40-pack-year smoking history, having quit approximately one year prior to presentation. She had been diagnosed with hypertension 15 years earlier, which was managed with amlodipine 5 mg daily. She denied any recent fevers, chest pain, or significant weight loss.
On physical examination, vital signs revealed oxygen saturation of 88% on room air, blood pressure of 135/82 mmHg, a heart rate of 92 bpm, and respiratory rate of 24 breaths per minute. She appeared in mild respiratory distress. Auscultation of the lungs revealed prolonged expiratory phases, with bilateral diffuse wheezing and reduced breath sounds at the bases. There was no peripheral edema, cyanosis, or significant clubbing. Cardiac exam revealed normal S1 and S2 without murmurs. Extremities were warm, and peripheral pulses were intact.
Initial investigations included a CBC, which revealed a WBC count of 6,800/Î¼L, hemoglobin of 13.4 g/dL, and no eosinophilia. Serum chemistry, including electrolytes and kidney function, was within normal limits. Arterial blood gas revealed pH 7.36, PaCO2 48 mmHg, and PaO2 58 mmHg on room air, consistent with respiratory acidosis and hypoxemia. A chest X-ray demonstrated hyperinflated lungs and flattened diaphragms with no obvious consolidation or masses. Spirometry results showed FEV1/FVC ratio of 0.62, FEV1 at 47% of the predicted value, and significant reduction in PEF, indicative of moderate-to-severe airflow obstruction without significant bronchodilator reversibility. No significant abnormalities were detected on ECG or echocardiography. Alpha-1 antitrypsin levels were within normal limits.
The patient was diagnosed with COPD, categorized as Group D based on GOLD criteria due to the severity of airflow limitation (FEV1 <50%), associated symptoms, and frequent exacerbations. A treatment plan was initiated with tiotropium 18 mcg inhaled daily and salmeterol 50 mcg and fluticasone propionate 250 mcg inhaled twice daily via dry powder inhaler. An albuterol inhaler (90 mcg/puff) was prescribed as needed for acute symptom relief. She was also started on a pulmonary rehabilitation program and advised to use oxygen therapy at 2 L/min for 16 hours per day due to chronic hypoxemia. Smoking cessation was reinforced, and she was enrolled in a smoking cessation support program.
During follow-up over the subsequent three months, the patient reported significant improvement in dyspnea and reduction in exertional symptoms. Repeat spirometry showed stable FEV1 values. Oxygen saturation was consistently maintained above 90% on supplemental oxygen. She demonstrated good adherence to her medications and lifestyle modifications, with no further exacerbations reported during this period. Pulmonary rehabilitation contributed to improved exercise tolerance and functional status."
