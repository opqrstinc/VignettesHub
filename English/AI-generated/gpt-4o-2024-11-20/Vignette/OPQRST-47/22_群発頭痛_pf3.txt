"A 32-year-old female presented with a primary complaint of severe unilateral headaches, localized around the right periorbital area, recurring daily for the past two weeks. The episodes began abruptly, typically lasting 60 to 90 minutes, and occurred up to three times daily, predominantly during the nighttime. The pain was described as excruciating, stabbing, and associated with ipsilateral nasal congestion and mild periorbital edema. She also reported lacrimation and conjunctival injection in the same eye during the attacks. No nausea, vomiting, photophobia, or phonophobia was noted. She denied prior similar episodes or a history of migraines. There was no trauma, recent infections, or significant personal or family medical history of neurological diseases. 
On physical examination between attacks, her vital signs were normal. General appearance was unremarkable; there were no cranial nerve deficits, motor or sensory abnormalities, or signs of infection. Ocular examination revealed no abnormalities apart from mild residual conjunctival injection on the right side. Neurological examination was otherwise unremarkable. During one observed headache episode in the ED, right-sided lacrimation, conjunctival injection, nasal congestion, and agitation were noted without aura or focal deficits.
Laboratory tests, including CBC, CMP, CRP, and ESR, were within normal ranges. Imaging studies, including a non-contrast CT and subsequent MRI of the brain, showed no intracranial abnormalities or space-occupying lesions. A CT angiogram to evaluate vascular abnormalities showed normal findings. Screening for other secondary causes of headache, such as infections, vascular pathologies, or structural abnormalities, was negative. Based on the clinical presentation, typical episodic pattern, and exclusion of secondary causes, the diagnosis of cluster headache was established.
Treatment was initiated with 100% oxygen inhalation at a flow rate of 12 L/min via a non-rebreather mask for 15 minutes, which significantly reduced symptom severity during acute attacks. For abortive therapy, subcutaneous sumatriptan 6 mg was administered with marked pain relief noted within 10 minutes. Prophylactic treatment commenced with verapamil at an initial dose of 80 mg orally three times daily, titrated to 120 mg three times daily over the course of one week based on tolerability and blood pressure monitoring. A follow-up ECG was performed to monitor for possible heart block, which remained normal. She was educated on potential triggers, including alcohol, bright lights, and lack of sleep, and instructed to avoid these where possible.
Over the following four weeks, the frequency and intensity of her headaches progressively decreased. She reported complete resolution of symptoms by the end of the third week of prophylactic treatment. At the one-month follow-up, the patient remained asymptomatic without any significant adverse effects or recurrence of cluster headache episodes. Long-term prophylactic management was planned, and she was advised to continue verapamil with periodic monitoring."
