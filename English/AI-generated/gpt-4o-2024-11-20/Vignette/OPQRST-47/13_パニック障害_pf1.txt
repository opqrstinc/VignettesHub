"An 18-year-old female presented with a chief complaint of dizziness and excessive sweating, which had begun abruptly 4 months prior. She described her symptoms as occurring suddenly and unpredictably, often accompanied by a sensation of impending doom, chest tightness, heart palpitations, and shortness of breath. These episodes typically lasted for 10–20 minutes and resolved spontaneously. They had occurred approximately 2–3 times per week since onset, leading to significant distress and impairment in her daily activities, including school attendance and social interactions. She reported no identifiable triggers for her symptoms. The patient denied any prior medical, psychiatric, or substance use history. There was no family history of psychiatric or cardiovascular disorders.
On physical examination, her vital signs were within normal limits with no remarkable findings. Cardiovascular, respiratory, and neurological examinations showed no abnormalities. Her BMI was in the normal range, and no signs of dehydration or significant weight changes were observed. Mental status examination revealed a mildly anxious affect but no evidence of psychosis, cognitive deficits, or disturbances in thought processes. 
Laboratory tests, including CBC, CMP, and TSH, were within the normal range. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with no findings suggestive of arrhythmia or structural abnormalities. An echocardiogram and ambulatory Holter monitoring were performed to rule out underlying cardiac conditions, both of which yielded normal results. A screening urine toxicology test was negative for substances of abuse. Given the presentation, a structured psychiatric interview was conducted, including the use of the DSM-5 criteria. She met the diagnostic criteria for panic disorder, specifically recurring unexpected panic attacks with associated fear of their recurrence and avoidance behaviors.
Management was initiated with sertraline, an SSRI, at an initial dose of 25 mg daily, titrated to 50 mg daily after one week. The patient was closely monitored during follow-up visits for tolerability and symptom improvement. Short-term symptomatic relief was provided with alprazolam, a benzodiazepine, at a dose of 0.25 mg as needed, not exceeding 1 mg per day and limited to a maximum period of 4 weeks, to avoid dependence. CBT was introduced in parallel, focusing on cognitive restructuring and graded exposure to anxiety-provoking situations. The patient participated in weekly sessions for 10 weeks.
By the third week of treatment, she reported a significant reduction in the frequency and intensity of panic attacks. By the sixth week, her dizziness and sweating episodes had decreased to once every two weeks, with substantially diminished severity. By the end of 12 weeks, her panic attacks had nearly resolved, and she resumed her usual activities without significant anxiety. Treatment with sertraline was continued at 50 mg daily, with plans to reassess after 6 months to determine the need for maintenance therapy. No adverse effects were reported during the treatment course."
