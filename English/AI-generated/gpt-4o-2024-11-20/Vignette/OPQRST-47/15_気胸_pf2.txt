"A 32-year-old female presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of chest discomfort and dyspnea that began approximately four hours prior to arrival. She reported that the symptoms started abruptly while she was at rest. The discomfort was localized to the left side of the chest and was described as sharp and non-radiating. She denied any history of trauma, fever, cough, hemoptysis, or recent respiratory infections. Her medical history was significant for bronchial asthma, which had been well-controlled with the use of inhaled corticosteroids and as-needed albuterol. She had no other significant comorbidities, no history of smoking, and no known family history of pulmonary conditions.
On physical examination, she appeared mildly distressed due to dyspnea but was alert and oriented. Vital signs revealed tachycardia with a heart rate of 110 bpm, respiratory rate of 26 breaths/min, decreased oxygen saturation of 92% on room air, and normal blood pressure. On auscultation, breath sounds were diminished on the left side, particularly in the apical and mid-lung zones, while respiratory sounds on the right side were unremarkable. No wheezing, crackles, or stridor were heard. Percussion of the chest revealed hyperresonance over the left thorax. No jugular venous distension or peripheral edema was evident. The remainder of the physical examination was unremarkable.
Initial CXR demonstrated a large left-sided pneumothorax, with a visible pleural line and absence of pulmonary markings peripherally. The left lung appeared partially collapsed, and the mediastinum was shifted mildly toward the right side, indicating a tension component. A non-contrast CT confirmed the diagnosis, showing a 40% pneumothorax on the left side without evidence of blebs or bullae. ABG analysis revealed mild hypoxemia with a PaO2 of 68 mmHg. Other routine blood tests, including CBC and metabolic panel, were within normal limits.
The diagnosis of a spontaneous left-sided pneumothorax was made. The condition was classified as secondary due to her history of bronchial asthma, which could predispose her to weakened lung architecture.
She underwent immediate decompression with the placement of a 16 Fr chest tube into the left pleural space. After successful placement, approximately 800 mL of air was evacuated, leading to immediate clinical improvement. Repeat CXR confirmed re-expansion of the left lung, without evidence of residual pneumothorax or complications such as hemothorax. She was managed conservatively with supplemental oxygen therapy at 4 L/min via nasal cannula. Analgesia was achieved with acetaminophen 1 g orally every six hours as needed. Albuterol nebulization was continued as required for occasional wheezing episodes, though no exacerbation of asthma was observed during her hospital stay.
By hospital day 2, her dyspnea had markedly improved. The chest tube was removed on day 3 after follow-up CXR demonstrated stable lung expansion and no recurrence of pneumothorax. She was discharged on day 4 with instructions to avoid flying or scuba diving for the next several weeks and advised to attend follow-up in the pulmonology clinic. No additional pharmacological therapy was prescribed, as her asthma remained stable. She was counseled on the risks of recurrence and advised to seek immediate medical attention if similar symptoms arose in the future."
