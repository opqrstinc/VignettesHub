"A 25-year-old male presented with chief complaints of dizziness, transient syncope, and palpitations. The symptoms initially appeared three months prior with episodes triggered by prolonged standing or emotional stress. Each episode began with prodromal symptoms such as lightheadedness, nausea, and diaphoresis, followed by a brief loss of consciousness lasting less than a minute. The patient reported spontaneous recovery without confusion or neurological deficits. No trauma or significant injuries were associated with the episodes. He denied chest pain, dyspnea, or symptoms suggestive of seizures. There was no history of similar episodes in the past, and his medical history was unremarkable. The patient reported no use of medications, alcohol, or recreational drugs, and no significant family history of cardiovascular or neurological disorders.
On physical examination, the patient was conscious, alert, and hemodynamically stable. BP measured 124/76 mmHg in the supine position and 92/64 mmHg after five minutes of standing, accompanied by a compensatory increase in HR from 72 bpm to 110 bpm. Cardiac examination revealed normal heart sounds without murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Neurological examination, including cranial nerves, motor, sensory, and cerebellar functions, was unremarkable. No abnormalities were noted during skin or respiratory evaluations.
Initial laboratory tests, including CBC, electrolytes, glucose, and renal and liver function tests, were within normal limits. ECG demonstrated normal sinus rhythm without conduction abnormalities, QT prolongation, or signs of ischemia. A 24-hour Holter monitor showed no evidence of arrhythmias or significant bradycardia. Echocardiography revealed normal LV function with no structural heart abnormalities. Tilt table testing provoked symptoms consistent with the patient's episodes, characterized by a sudden BP drop accompanied by bradycardia. EEG was performed to rule out a neurological cause and was unremarkable.
The diagnosis of neurocardiogenic syncope (NCS), also referred to as vasovagal syncope, was established based on clinical presentation, tilt table test results, and the exclusion of other potential causes.
Initial management included education on avoiding triggers such as prolonged standing, dehydration, and emotional stress, as well as physical counter-pressure maneuvers during prodromal symptoms. The patient was advised to increase dietary salt and fluid intake to improve intravascular volume. Given the frequency and impact of episodes, pharmacologic intervention with midodrine was initiated at a starting dose of 5 mg orally three times daily, with instructions to take the last dose at least four hours before bedtime to minimize supine hypertension. The patient was closely monitored for side effects, including piloerection and scalp pruritus, but these were mild and did not require dose alteration.
Over follow-up visits spanning three months, the patient reported significant symptom improvement with no further episodes of syncope. He was encouraged to continue non-pharmacological measures alongside midodrine therapy and was counseled on gradual medication tapering as symptoms stabilized. Repeat assessments showed persistent hemodynamic stability, and the patient returned to normal daily activities without limitation. Regular follow-up was recommended to monitor for recurrence or medication-related adverse effects."
