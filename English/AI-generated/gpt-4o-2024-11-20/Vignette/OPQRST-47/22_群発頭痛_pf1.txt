"A 45-year-old male presented with a chief complaint of recurrent episodes of severe unilateral pain localized around the left eye, associated with tearing and nasal congestion. The episodes had been occurring daily for the past two weeks and were most prominent during the evening hours, often awakening him from sleep. Each episode lasted approximately 60â€“120 minutes and resolved spontaneously without residual symptoms. He denied any similar episodes in the past and reported no history of migraines or other headache disorders. There was no associated aura, nausea, or vomiting. His medical history was unremarkable, with no prior diagnoses, surgeries, or medication use, and there was no family history of headache disorders or neurological diseases. He denied alcohol or illicit drug use.
On physical examination, the patient appeared in distress during an active episode but was otherwise well between attacks. Vital signs were within normal limits. Inspection during an episode revealed ipsilateral conjunctival injection and lacrimation, along with nasal congestion and rhinorrhea. There were no focal neurological deficits observed. Fundoscopic examination was unremarkable, and there were no signs of papilledema or other abnormalities on cranial nerve assessment. The remainder of the physical and neurological examination was normal.
Laboratory tests, including CBC, CMP, and inflammatory markers (ESR, CRP), were within normal limits. An MRI of the brain with contrast was performed to exclude structural abnormalities or secondary causes of headache and was reported as normal. No evidence of vascular malformations, space-occupying lesions, or other intracranial pathology was identified. Further diagnostic workup was not deemed necessary based on clinical presentation.
The patient was diagnosed with cluster headache based on the ICHD-3 criteria, given the stereotypical nature of the pain, associated autonomic symptoms, and episodic pattern. No alternative explanation for his symptoms was identified.
Treatment was initiated with 100% oxygen delivered via a non-rebreather mask at a flow rate of 12 L/min for 15 minutes during acute attacks, which provided substantial relief. Additionally, he was prescribed sumatriptan 6 mg SC for use as an abortive therapy when oxygen was unavailable. For preventative treatment, verapamil 240 mg/day was initiated, divided into two doses with gradual up-titration planned based on symptom control and tolerability. During follow-up after four weeks, the frequency of attacks had significantly decreased, with complete resolution reported by eight weeks. No adverse effects from treatment were noted. The patient was counseled regarding avoidance of potential triggers, including alcohol, and was advised to maintain a headache diary for documentation of recurrence."
