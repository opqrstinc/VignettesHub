"A 38-year-old female presented with a chief complaint of difficulty sleeping and impaired concentration for the past 3 months. She reported taking more than an hour to initiate sleep almost every night and frequently waking up during the night, leading to non-restorative sleep. She mentioned these symptoms started gradually and had worsened over time. In addition to sleep disturbances, she experienced persistent fatigue, irritability, and reduced ability to focus at work. She denied any significant changes in appetite or weight loss but described feelings of frustration about her inability to fall asleep. She reported a past diagnosis of depression 5 years ago, which was treated with sertraline, but she stopped the medication 3 years ago and had not sought follow-up care since. She denied current mood changes or suicidal ideation. There was no history of alcohol or illicit drug use. No family history of sleep disorders was noted.
On physical examination, vital signs were within normal limits. Neurological and psychiatric examinations were unremarkable, with no evidence of psychomotor agitation or retardation. The physical exam revealed no apparent abnormalities, and no cranial nerve deficits, motor weakness, or sensory loss were noted. Her BMI was within the normal range. She appeared tired during the interview, but her speech and thought processes were coherent and logical.
Laboratory tests, including CBC, CMP, and TSH, were conducted to exclude organic causes of fatigue and insomnia. All results were within normal limits. Polysomnography was not performed at this stage, as the clinical history and symptomatology were sufficient for a diagnosis. Screening questionnaires, including the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), were administered. Scores on both assessments supported a diagnosis of insomnia disorder. The differential diagnosis included primary insomnia, psychiatric conditions such as depression and anxiety, medication-induced insomnia, and circadian rhythm disturbances. Based on the patient's history, pattern of sleep disturbances, and absence of other contributing factors, primary insomnia was diagnosed.
The patient was started on CBT-I, which included sleep hygiene education, stimulus control therapy, and sleep restriction techniques. Pharmacologic treatment was initiated with low-dose zolpidem 5 mg nightly as needed to assist with sleep onset. She was advised to avoid stimulants like caffeine in the evening and to establish a consistent bedtime routine. Follow-up occurred after 2 weeks, at which time she reported moderate improvement in sleep latency and a reduction in the number of awakenings during the night. Zolpidem was continued at the same dose, and CBT-I sessions were scheduled weekly. After 4 weeks of therapy, her ISI score showed significant improvement, and she reported feeling more rested in the morning and regaining her ability to concentrate during the day. She did not experience any adverse effects from zolpidem, and no dose adjustments were necessary. On subsequent follow-up at 3 months, her insomnia symptoms had resolved, and zolpidem was gradually tapered off. Maintenance of behavioral strategies learned through CBT-I was emphasized to prevent relapse."
