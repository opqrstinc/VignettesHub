"A 68-year-old male presented with a chief complaint of acute-onset right upper quadrant (RUQ) abdominal pain lasting for 24 hours. The pain was described as constant, severe, and radiating to the right shoulder. It was accompanied by fever, nausea, and chills. The patient denied any previous episodes of similar pain, recent trauma, changes in bowel habits, or weight loss. He reported dark-colored urine and yellowing of the eyes over the past day. The patient had no significant past medical history, no history of gallstone disease, or prior abdominal surgeries. He did not take any medications and denied alcohol use or smoking.
On physical examination, the patient demonstrated a temperature of 38.9°C, a heart rate of 102 bpm, and BP of 135/82 mmHg. He appeared acutely ill. Mild scleral icterus was noted. Abdominal examination revealed RUQ tenderness with guarding and a positive Murphy's sign. Bowel sounds were normal, and no palpable masses or organomegaly were detected. There was no evidence of rebound tenderness or generalized peritonitis. Cardiovascular and pulmonary examinations were unremarkable.
Laboratory results showed an elevated WBC count of 16,200/μL with neutrophil predominance. CRP was markedly elevated at 12.4 mg/dL. LFTs demonstrated total bilirubin of 3.4 mg/dL, direct bilirubin of 2.7 mg/dL, ALP of 278 U/L, AST of 96 U/L, and ALT of 82 U/L. Serum amylase and lipase levels were within normal limits. Blood cultures were pending at the time of presentation. RUQ abdominal US revealed an enlarged and thickened gallbladder wall (5 mm), pericholecystic fluid, and a distended gallbladder with multiple gallstones. Sonographic Murphy's sign was positive. No biliary ductal dilation or choledocholithiasis was identified. Again, the patient demonstrated no signs of septic shock or multiorgan dysfunction.
The diagnosis of acute calculous cholecystitis was confirmed based on clinical presentation, laboratory abnormalities, and radiographic findings.
The patient was treated with intravenous hydration and empirical antibiotic therapy. Piperacillin-tazobactam at a dosage of 4.5 g every 8 hours was initiated. Pain control was managed with intravenous acetaminophen, 1 g every 6 hours as needed. Surgical consultation was obtained, and laparoscopic cholecystectomy was recommended. Preoperative optimization was completed, and the patient underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy within 48 hours of admission. Intraoperative findings confirmed an inflamed gallbladder with multiple gallstones, but no evidence of gallbladder perforation or bile duct injury. The patient tolerated the procedure well.
Postoperatively, the patient’s RUQ pain and fever resolved. Antibiotic therapy with piperacillin-tazobactam was continued for 72 hours post-laparoscopic cholecystectomy and discontinued thereafter. He was discharged home on postoperative day 3 with instructions for routine follow-up. At a follow-up visit 2 weeks later, he had fully recovered without any complications or recurrence of symptoms. Blood cultures obtained on admission showed no bacterial growth."
