"A 65-year-old male presented with a chief complaint of tremors primarily affecting his left hand and a sensation of impaired balance. The symptoms were first noticed approximately one year prior to presentation and had gradually worsened over time. Initially, the tremor was intermittent and mild, occurring predominantly at rest but improving with voluntary movement. However, over the past six months, the tremor became more persistent and noticeable, and he also reported increasing difficulty with tasks requiring fine motor control, such as buttoning his shirt. He experienced a generalized sense of slowness in movement and occasional stiffness, particularly in the morning. The patient had no significant medical history and denied recent head trauma, toxin exposure, or use of medications that could induce parkinsonism. There was no family history of neurological disorders.
On physical examination, a resting tremor measuring approximately 4–6 Hz was observed in the patient’s left hand, which diminished with intentional movement. Rigidity was noted in both upper and lower extremities, more pronounced on the left side. Bradykinesia was evident during finger tapping and rapid alternating movement tests. He exhibited a stooped posture and reduced arm swing during gait assessment. His tandem gait was impaired, and the pull test revealed a slight delay in postural correction. Cranial nerve examination and motor strength were normal, and no cerebellar signs were observed. There was no dysmetria, and deep tendon reflexes were within normal limits.
Laboratory testing including CBC, CMP, thyroid function tests, and serum ceruloplasmin yielded results within normal limits. Imaging studies, including a brain CT and MRI, excluded structural abnormalities such as stroke, tumor, or normal-pressure hydrocephalus. A dopamine transporter (DaT)-SPECT scan revealed decreased radiotracer uptake in the putamen bilaterally, consistent with a presynaptic dopaminergic deficit.
The patient was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease (PD) based on the clinical presentation and supportive findings from DaT-SPECT imaging. The diagnosis was aligned with the UK Parkinson’s Disease Society Brain Bank clinical diagnostic criteria.
Treatment was initiated with carbidopa/levodopa at a dosage of 25/100 mg three times daily. Over a period of three months, the patient reported significant improvement in the tremor and bradykinesia, with partial resolution of the rigidity. Dose adjustments were subsequently made to optimize symptom control, increasing the dosage to 25/100 mg four times daily. An MAO-B inhibitor, rasagiline 1 mg once daily, was added to address residual motor symptoms. He was enrolled in a physical therapy program focused on improving balance and posture and encouraged to engage in regular exercise. Six months after initiating therapy, his gait and overall motor function had improved, and he expressed satisfaction with his quality of life. No significant medication side effects, including dyskinesias or orthostatic hypotension, were observed during follow-up."
