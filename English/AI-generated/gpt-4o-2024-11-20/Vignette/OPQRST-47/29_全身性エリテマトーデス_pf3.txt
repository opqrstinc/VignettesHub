"A 35-year-old female presented with a 2-month history of a malar rash, progressive hair loss, and polyarthralgia. These symptoms were insidious in onset but gradually worsened over time. She reported fatigue, mild fever, and photosensitivity during the same period. She denied any prior dermatologic or rheumatologic conditions. There was no family history of autoimmune diseases, and she had no history of smoking, drug use, or prior hospitalizations.
On physical examination, she had a well-demarcated erythematous rash over the malar eminences sparing the nasolabial folds. Diffuse thinning of scalp hair was noted without obvious scarring. Swelling and tenderness were present in the bilateral metacarpophalangeal, proximal interphalangeal, and wrist joints. No deformities were observed. Cardiovascular, respiratory, and abdominal examinations were unremarkable. Neurological deficits were absent.
Laboratory investigations revealed the following: ANA was positive at a titer of 1:1280 in a homogeneous pattern. Anti-dsDNA and anti-Smith antibodies were strongly positive. ESR and CRP levels were elevated. CBC showed mild leukopenia (3,500/ÂµL) and anemia (Hb 10.5 g/dL) with normal platelet counts. Serum complement levels (C3, C4) were decreased. Urinalysis demonstrated proteinuria (1.2 g/day) but no hematuria or cellular casts. Renal function tests, including serum creatinine and eGFR, were within normal limits. Serum tests for hepatitis B, C, and HIV yielded negative results.
Based on her clinical presentation and laboratory data, a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) was established according to the ACR/EULAR classification criteria.
Initial therapy included prednisone 40 mg daily to manage systemic inflammation. Hydroxychloroquine was started at a dose of 300 mg daily for long-term disease control. To address polyarthritis and skin manifestations, methotrexate was initiated at 15 mg weekly alongside folic acid 1 mg daily to mitigate side effects. The patient was advised to use sunscreen and avoid direct sunlight to reduce photosensitive flares. Frequent monitoring of renal function, blood counts, and disease markers was planned.
Over the next 2 months, her symptoms showed significant improvement. The malar rash faded, hair shedding reduced, and joint pain subsided. Laboratory parameters also improved, with normalization of ESR and a decrease in anti-dsDNA antibody levels. The prednisone dose was gradually tapered to 10 mg daily to minimize corticosteroid-related adverse effects, while hydroxychloroquine and methotrexate were continued. Surveillance for potential complications, including nephritis and thromboembolic events, remained ongoing."
