"A 17-year-old male with no significant past medical history presented with a 3-day history of progressive dyspnea, fever, and a non-productive cough. He denied any recent travel, exposure to sick contacts, or known allergens. He reported no personal or family history of atopic diseases or asthma and had no history of chronic respiratory symptoms. On further questioning, he revealed that he had recently started smoking cigarettes approximately two weeks prior to symptom onset, consuming around five cigarettes per day. He denied the use of e-cigarettes, recreational drugs, or other inhalational exposures.
On physical examination, his vital signs revealed a temperature of 38.6°C, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, heart rate of 110 bpm, and oxygen saturation of 88% on room air. He appeared anxious and in mild respiratory distress. Auscultation of the lungs revealed diffuse bilateral crackles without wheezes or significant areas of consolidation. No peripheral edema, skin rashes, or lymphadenopathy were noted. Cardiac, abdominal, and neurological examinations were unremarkable.
Initial laboratory tests demonstrated peripheral eosinophilia with a WBC of 12,200/μL, eosinophils accounting for 18%. Hemoglobin, platelets, and basic metabolic panel were within normal limits. Arterial blood gas on room air showed hypoxemia with a PaO2 of 58 mmHg and a mild respiratory alkalosis. Chest X-ray revealed bilateral patchy infiltrates predominantly in the lower lung zones. CT scan of the chest showed diffuse ground-glass opacities with sparing of the costophrenic angles, but no evidence of pleural effusion, nodules, or significant consolidation. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed, which revealed an elevated eosinophil count of 38% with no evidence of infection on microbiological studies, including bacterial, viral, and fungal cultures. Serological tests for parasitic infections, autoimmune markers, and HIV were negative. Serum IgE levels were elevated.
The patient was diagnosed with acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP) based on clinical presentation, imaging, and BAL findings. The likely trigger in this case was the recent initiation of smoking.
He was started on methylprednisolone at an initial dose of 1 mg/kg/day IV. Within 48 hours of treatment initiation, there was significant clinical improvement, with resolution of fever and dyspnea. His oxygen saturation improved to 95% on room air, and the peripheral eosinophilia resolved. By day 5 of hospitalization, the patient was transitioned to oral prednisone at 40 mg/day, with plans for a tapering regimen over 4 weeks. A repeat chest X-ray at discharge showed marked resolution of the pulmonary infiltrates.
At a 4-week follow-up, the patient reported complete symptom resolution, and a repeat chest radiograph confirmed the absence of residual pulmonary abnormalities. He was counseled on smoking cessation, which he committed to during follow-up visits. No recurrence of symptoms was noted over the subsequent 3 months of monitoring."
