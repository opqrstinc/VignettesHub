"A 35-year-old female with a history of childhood asthma presented with a several-month history of fatigue, unintentional weight loss of approximately 6 kg, and intermittent abdominal pain localized to the right lower quadrant. The abdominal pain was described as crampy, occurring several times weekly, and often worsened postprandially. She reported associated loose, non-bloody stools occurring 3–5 times per day. There was no history of recent travel, antibiotic use, or sick contacts. She denied fever, night sweats, or other constitutional symptoms aside from those mentioned.
On physical examination, her BMI was calculated at 18.9 kg/m², reflecting mild undernutrition. Vital signs were within normal limits. Examination revealed a soft but mildly tender right lower quadrant with no rebound tenderness or guarding. No palpable masses were noted. There was no peripheral lymphadenopathy, oral ulcers, perianal skin tags, or fistulas. Cardiopulmonary and neurologic examination findings were unremarkable.
Initial laboratory evaluation showed a mild anemia (Hb 10.8 g/dL), elevated ESR (48 mm/hr), and CRP (18 mg/L), suggestive of active inflammation. CBC revealed a leukocyte count within normal limits, though there was a slight elevation in platelet count (410 × 10³/µL). Serum albumin levels were mildly decreased at 3.2 g/dL. Serological testing for celiac disease, including anti-tTG antibodies, was negative. Stool studies were negative for infections, including C. difficile toxin, ova, and parasites; fecal calprotectin was markedly elevated at 520 µg/g, a finding consistent with intestinal inflammation.
Imaging studies included a CT enterography, which demonstrated mural thickening and enhancement of the terminal ileum with associated mesenteric fat stranding and lymphadenopathy. These findings were confirmed by ileocolonoscopy, which revealed linear ulcerations and patchy inflamed mucosa in the terminal ileum consistent with skip lesions. Random biopsies of the terminal ileum demonstrated chronic inflammation with non-caseating granulomas on histopathology, diagnostic of Crohn’s disease.
The patient was initiated on induction therapy with prednisone 40 mg daily, which led to significant improvement in symptoms over the following weeks. Due to the chronic nature of the disease, maintenance treatment with adalimumab, a TNF-α inhibitor, was commenced at 160 mg subcutaneously on day 1, 80 mg on day 15, and subsequently 40 mg every other week. Azathioprine 2 mg/kg daily was added as a steroid-sparing immunomodulator. Tapering of prednisone was achieved over an 8-week period without symptom recurrence.
At 3-month follow-up, she remained in clinical remission, reporting no abdominal pain or diarrhea. Repeat laboratory tests showed normalization of CRP and ESR, while fecal calprotectin levels had decreased significantly. A repeat ileocolonoscopy performed at 6 months demonstrated mucosal healing with resolution of prior ulcerations. Maintenance therapy with adalimumab and azathioprine was continued."
