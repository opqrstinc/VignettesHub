"A 73-year-old female with a history of diabetes presented with a chief complaint of intermittent chest pain persisting for two days. The pain was described as a squeezing sensation localized to the retrosternal area, radiating to the left arm, and was accompanied by diaphoresis and palpitations. These symptoms occurred predominantly during exertion, such as walking or climbing stairs, and resolved with rest. She denied any nausea, vomiting, or syncope. There was no history of fever or recent respiratory infection. Her past medical history was significant for type 2 diabetes, diagnosed 15 years prior, managed with oral hypoglycemic agents. She also reported a family history of ischemic heart disease. No prior episodes of angina or MI were noted.
On physical examination, her vital signs were as follows: BP of 145/88 mmHg, HR of 98 bpm, and RR of 18 per minute, with SpO2 at 96% on room air. She appeared mildly distressed due to her symptoms, but her speech was coherent. Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rhythm without murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Peripheral pulses were present and symmetric bilaterally. No signs of jugular venous distension or peripheral edema were observed. Respiratory and abdominal examinations were unremarkable.
Initial laboratory tests showed HbA1c of 7.4%, indicating suboptimal glycemic control. Troponin I levels were within the normal reference range on serial measurements, ruling out acute MI. A 12-lead ECG demonstrated nonspecific ST-segment changes and T-wave flattening in the inferior leads but no definitive evidence of ST-elevation or Q-wave abnormalities. A chest X-ray revealed no acute abnormalities, and BNP levels were not elevated. TTE revealed normal ejection fraction without regional wall motion abnormalities. Stress myocardial perfusion imaging revealed inducible ischemia in the left anterior descending artery territory, confirming myocardial ischemia under stress conditions.
Based on her presentation, medical history, and diagnostic findings, a diagnosis of unstable angina was established. The patient was promptly admitted to the telemetry unit for close monitoring and further management. She was initiated on sublingual nitroglycerin 0.4 mg as needed for chest pain episodes, which provided prompt symptom relief. Continuous IV infusion of nitroglycerin was started at 10 mcg/min and titrated upward to control symptoms. Aspirin 325 mg daily was administered as an antiplatelet agent. Clopidogrel 75 mg daily was started for dual antiplatelet therapy. A high-intensity statin, atorvastatin 40 mg daily, was also initiated to manage hyperlipidemia and stabilize atherosclerotic plaques. Additionally, metoprolol tartrate 25 mg twice daily was prescribed to reduce myocardial oxygen demand. Enoxaparin 1 mg/kg subcutaneously every 12 hours was administered to achieve anticoagulation. Her oral diabetes medication regimen was adjusted by replacing sulfonylureas with insulin glargine 10 units nightly to maintain glycemic control during hospitalization and reduce the risk of medication-induced hypoglycemia.
Over the course of her hospitalization, the patient remained hemodynamically stable with no recurrent episodes of chest pain. Repeat ECG showed no significant changes, and cardiac biomarkers remained within normal limits. She was scheduled for early outpatient follow-up with cardiology for consideration of elective coronary angiography. Comprehensive education regarding lifestyle modifications, adherence to prescribed medications, and recognition of warning symptoms was provided before discharge."
