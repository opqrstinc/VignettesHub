"A 42-year-old male with a history of diabetes presented with progressive dysphagia to solid foods and occasional coughing during meals over the past six months. Initially, the patient reported mild difficulty swallowing solid foods, which gradually worsened, leading to avoidance of certain meals. He experienced retrosternal discomfort after eating, especially with larger meals. There was no significant weight loss, regurgitation, nocturnal cough, or hematemesis. The patient denied smoking, alcohol use, or the use of NSAIDs. There was no family history of gastrointestinal disorders.
On physical examination, the patient appeared well-nourished with no acute distress. Vital signs were within normal limits. Abdomen was soft, non-tender, and demonstrated no organomegaly. Chest auscultation revealed normal breath sounds bilaterally without signs of aspiration or wheezing. Neurological and cardiovascular examinations were unremarkable. There were no signs of lymphadenopathy or skin abnormalities.
Laboratory studies showed no abnormalities in CBC, CMP, and glucose levels were well-controlled with an HbA1c of 6.8%. Esophageal manometry demonstrated increased LES pressure at 38 mmHg with incomplete relaxation and aperistalsis in the distal esophagus, consistent with type II achalasia. Barium swallow revealed delayed esophageal emptying, a bird-beak appearance of the distal esophagus, and significant narrowing at the gastroesophageal junction without signs of mass or obstruction. An EGD was performed to exclude malignancy or structural abnormalities, showing no evidence of strictures, malignancy, or esophagitis.
The diagnosis of achalasia was made based on clinical, manometric, radiologic, and endoscopic findings. Management included pneumatic dilation performed under fluoroscopic guidance, resulting in symptomatic improvement. In addition, the patient was prescribed nitrates (isosorbide dinitrate 5 mg sublingually as needed) to lower LES pressure and improve swallowing. To prevent and manage any potential reflux symptoms, PPI therapy (omeprazole 20 mg daily) was initiated. Botulinum toxin injection was considered but deferred due to the success of pneumatic dilation.
Upon follow-up at one month, the patient reported significant improvements in dysphagia and no recurrence of coughing episodes during meals. Repeat barium swallow showed improved esophageal emptying without residual narrowing of the LES. There were no new symptoms, including regurgitation or chest pain. Lifestyle modifications, including smaller, more frequent meals and upright positioning after eating, were advised to further optimize outcomes."
