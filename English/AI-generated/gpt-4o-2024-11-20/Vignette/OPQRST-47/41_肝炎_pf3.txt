"A 28-year-old male presented with a 3-day history of fever, nausea, vomiting, and progressive jaundice. He reported fatigue, anorexia, and dark-colored urine over the preceding week. There was no history of travel, significant alcohol use, or illicit drug use, and he denied any prior medical conditions or regular medication use. He worked as a software engineer and had no known sick contacts or recent episodes of similar symptoms.
On physical examination, he appeared icteric and fatigued but was afebrile at the time of presentation. Conjunctival icterus was evident, and there were no signs of chronic liver disease such as ascites or spider angiomas. Abdominal examination revealed mild right upper quadrant tenderness without hepatomegaly or splenomegaly. There was no lymphadenopathy or rash. His vital signs were normal, and no encephalopathy was observed.
Laboratory investigations showed AST 1024 U/L, ALT 1202 U/L, ALP 315 U/L, total bilirubin 9.2 mg/dL, direct bilirubin 6.5 mg/dL, and INR 1.3. CBC revealed WBC 7,500/mm³, Hb 15.2 g/dL, and platelets 245,000/mm³. Renal function and electrolytes were within normal limits. Serologies for viral hepatitis were positive for anti-HAV IgM and negative for HBsAg, anti-HCV, and anti-HEV IgM. Testing for EBV, CMV, and HIV was non-reactive. Autoimmune markers and iron studies were unremarkable. An abdominal US demonstrated no biliary obstruction, normal liver echotexture, and no evidence of ascites. FibroScan was not performed due to the acute presentation.
The patient was diagnosed with acute HAV infection. Supportive treatment was initiated with proper hydration using 1 L of IV 0.9% saline daily for the first 2 days due to mild dehydration. He was advised on a low-fat diet and instructed to avoid hepatotoxic substances, including alcohol and unnecessary medications. Symptomatic management included ondansetron 4 mg orally every 8 hours as needed for vomiting. No antiviral therapy was required given the self-limiting nature of HAV.
During follow-up visits over the next 4 weeks, his symptoms gradually improved. Jaundice resolved within 3 weeks, and LFTs showed a declining trend with AST 45 U/L, ALT 50 U/L, and bilirubin 0.8 mg/dL at 4 weeks. He was instructed to maintain good hygiene practices and was counseled on HAV vaccination for close household contacts to prevent further transmission. At 3 months, a complete recovery was documented with normal LFTs and no residual symptoms."
