"A 55-year-old female presented with a chief complaint of progressive low back pain radiating to both lower extremities, primarily the posterior thighs and calves, which gradually developed over the past year. The pain initially occurred intermittently but had intensified in the last three months, leading to a significant limitation in her ability to ambulate. She reported symptoms of neurogenic claudication, including pain and numbness in the legs after walking approximately 50 meters, which was relieved by sitting or assuming a forward-flexed posture. She denied any history of trauma, fever, unexplained weight loss, or bowel or bladder dysfunction. There was no past history of chronic illness, surgeries, or injuries.
On physical examination, she exhibited an antalgic gait and demonstrated difficulty in maintaining a standing position for prolonged periods due to discomfort in the lumbar region and lower extremities. Inspection revealed no visible deformities or muscle atrophy. Palpation elicited tenderness in the paraspinal region at the lumbar level, but no overt warmth or erythema was noted. Neurological examination revealed reduced sensation to light touch and pinprick in an L5 distribution bilaterally. Muscle strength testing showed mild weakness (4/5) in ankle dorsiflexion and great toe extension bilaterally. Deep tendon reflexes were diminished at the knees and absent at the Achilles tendons. The straight leg raise test was negative bilaterally, while the femoral nerve stretch test reproduced her symptoms. There were no signs of upper motor neuron involvement, such as hyperreflexia or Babinski sign.
Radiographic evaluation using plain lumbar X-rays demonstrated age-appropriate degenerative changes without evidence of significant spinal deformity. MRI of the lumbar spine revealed significant narrowing of the central canal at L4-L5 and L5-S1 levels due to ligamentum flavum hypertrophy, disc bulging, and facet joint arthropathy. Axial T2-weighted images confirmed a cross-sectional canal area of less than 75 mmÂ² at these levels. Electromyography studies were consistent with chronic neurogenic changes involving the L5 nerve root.
The diagnosis of lumbar spinal stenosis with neurogenic claudication was established based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings. Conservative management was initiated with physical therapy aimed at core muscle strengthening and postural correction. She was started on acetaminophen 1,000 mg every eight hours as needed for pain, supplemented by gabapentin 300 mg three times daily for neuropathic pain. Additionally, a short course of oral prednisone at a tapering dose starting from 40 mg daily for one week was prescribed to reduce inflammation. She was also advised to maintain a weight management program and avoid prolonged standing or high-impact activities.
At the one-month follow-up, she reported modest improvement in pain and walking tolerance, with claudication symptoms occurring after walking 100 meters. A caudal epidural steroid injection consisting of 40 mg methylprednisolone acetate was administered to provide relief from persistent symptoms. At the three-month follow-up, her walking capacity had improved to 200 meters without significant pain, and she was satisfied with the results of combined conservative treatment and interventional management. Surgical decompression was discussed as a future option if her symptoms progressed or failed to respond adequately to non-operative treatment."
