"A 60-year-old male presented with complaints of progressive low back pain radiating to both lower extremities, numbness in the legs, and difficulty walking that had persisted for six months. The pain was described as intermittent, worsening with prolonged standing and walking, and partially relieved by sitting or leaning forward. He reported a reduction in his ability to ambulate longer distances due to increasing discomfort and leg weakness. His symptoms progressively limited his daily activities, and he reported an inability to walk more than 100 meters without experiencing significant leg pain and numbness. He had a known history of lumbar disc herniation diagnosed 15 years prior and had been managed conservatively at that time. He denied any significant trauma, recent infections, or systemic symptoms such as fever, weight loss, or night sweats.
On physical examination, his lumbar spine showed a decreased range of motion, particularly on extension. There was tenderness over the lower lumbar region without bony deformities. Straight leg raising was negative bilaterally. Neurological examination revealed diminished sensation to light touch over the lateral aspects of both lower legs and feet. Strength testing showed mild weakness, graded 4/5, in bilateral ankle dorsiflexion. Reflexes were hypoactive in the Achilles tendons bilaterally, while the patellar reflexes were preserved. No significant muscle atrophy or signs of upper motor neuron lesions were observed. Pulses in the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial arteries were bilaterally palpable.
MRI of the lumbar spine demonstrated central canal narrowing at the L4-L5 level caused by ligamentum flavum hypertrophy, disc bulging, and facet joint hypertrophy. Mild narrowing was also noted at L3-L4 and L5-S1 levels. T2-weighted images showed high signal intensity in the affected areas, consistent with stenosis. There was no evidence of significant disc herniation or spinal compression fracture. X-rays of the lumbar spine revealed degenerative changes, including decreased intervertebral disc height, osteophyte formation, and facet joint sclerosis. Routine blood tests, including CBC, CMP, ESR, and CRP, were within normal limits, ruling out infectious or inflammatory etiologies.
Based on the clinical presentation, imaging findings, and exclusion of red flag symptoms, the patient was diagnosed with lumbar spinal stenosis, primarily at the L4-L5 level.
Initial treatment was conservative. He was prescribed physical therapy focused on core strengthening and lumbar flexion exercises. Pharmacological management included acetaminophen (500 mg orally every 6 hours as needed) and ibuprofen (400 mg orally every 8 hours as needed for pain). Gabapentin (300 mg orally at bedtime) was initiated to manage neuropathic pain. After six weeks, his symptoms showed minimal improvement, and his walking distance remained limited. Epidural steroid injection with dexamethasone was administered at the affected level, resulting in moderate symptom relief for three months.
Due to persistent symptoms significantly impairing his quality of life, surgical intervention was considered. He underwent decompressive laminectomy at L4-L5 without fusion. Postoperatively, he reported a marked improvement in his symptoms, including reduced pain and increased walking capacity. During a three-month follow-up, his neurological examination was unremarkable, and he had regained his ability to perform daily activities independently. Pain management included acetaminophen (500 mg orally thrice daily as needed) and gabapentin (300 mg orally nightly for residual neuropathy), both tapered off gradually."
