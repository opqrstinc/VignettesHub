"A 55-year-old male presented with a chief complaint of vertigo that was triggered by head movements. He reported that the vertigo was most pronounced in the morning, especially upon getting out of bed. The symptom first occurred two days prior to his clinic visit and had persisted intermittently since then. He described the vertigo as a spinning sensation, lasting less than a minute, without associated otalgia, hearing loss, or tinnitus. He denied diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, limb weakness, or loss of consciousness. His past medical history included well-controlled hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus, both managed with medication. He denied any recent trauma, upper respiratory infections, or new medications.
On physical examination, the patient appeared well and was hemodynamically stable. Positional maneuvers, particularly the Dix-Hallpike test, reproduced his symptoms of vertigo when the head was turned to the right and lowered rapidly. This positioning elicited nystagmus characterized by a brief latency, upbeating, and torsional eye movements that resolved within 30 seconds. Neurological examination showed no focal deficits, and cranial nerve testing was normal. Motor strength, sensory examination, coordination, and gait were unremarkable. Otoscopic examination revealed no abnormal findings, and there was no evidence of spontaneous nystagmus in the primary gaze.
Laboratory studies were not performed as they were not deemed necessary for the suspected diagnosis. Brain MRI was not ordered because clinical features strongly suggested a peripheral etiology rather than a central process. Audiometry was not conducted, as the patient reported no hearing-related symptoms. The positional nystagmus produced during the Dix-Hallpike maneuver was diagnostic of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), specifically affecting the posterior semicircular canal of the right ear.
The patient was treated using the Epley maneuver, administered during the same visit. He tolerated the procedure well, and his vertigo improved significantly afterward. He was instructed on proper techniques to avoid abrupt head movements and to sleep with the head slightly elevated for the first night post-treatment. Pharmacological treatment was not initiated, as his symptoms were attributed to BPPV and resolved with the Epley maneuver. However, patient education emphasized that a reappearance of similar symptoms might necessitate repeat positional maneuvers rather than medication.
On a follow-up visit one week later, the patient reported complete resolution of vertigo. Repeat Dix-Hallpike testing was negative for nystagmus or reproduction of vertigo. He had returned to his regular activities without limitation. Blood pressure and glucose control remained stable, with no adjustments made to his antihypertensive or antidiabetic medications. At this time, no further interventions were deemed necessary."
