"A 23-year-old male presented with recurrent episodes of palpitations, chest discomfort, and shortness of breath that had persisted for the past 3 months. Each episode occurred suddenly, often without any identifiable trigger, and typically lasted for 10-15 minutes. During these episodes, the patient also experienced dizziness, nausea, a sense of impending doom, and a fear of losing control. The frequency of episodes increased over time, occurring at least 2-3 times per week. He reported avoiding crowded places and social gatherings due to fear of experiencing similar episodes in public. There was no history of syncope, fever, weight loss, or respiratory symptoms. The patient denied any significant medical or psychiatric history, and his family history was unremarkable for cardiovascular disease, mental illness, or substance abuse. He reported occasional alcohol consumption but denied illicit drug use.
On physical examination, his vital signs were within normal limits. HR was 82 bpm, BP was 122/76 mmHg, and RR was 16/min. His respiratory and cardiovascular examinations were unremarkable, with no murmurs, gallops, or wheezing. Neurological assessment revealed no deficits, and abdominal and musculoskeletal examinations were normal. Skin and mucous membranes appeared healthy, with no signs of infection or systemic disease. No abnormal findings were observed related to his thyroid.
Initial lab testing including CBC, CMP, TSH, and free T4 were within normal limits. An ECG performed during a non-episodic period showed normal sinus rhythm without any ST-T changes, arrhythmias, or conduction abnormalities. A 24-hour Holter monitoring did not reveal significant arrhythmias and correlated with the patient's reported symptoms. A chest X-ray showed no evidence of pulmonary abnormalities, and an echocardiogram demonstrated normal cardiac structure and function. Additional testing, including a urine toxicology screen, was negative.
After thorough evaluation, the patient was diagnosed with panic disorder based on DSM-5 criteria. He met the criteria of recurrent and unexpected panic attacks, accompanied by a persistent concern about having additional attacks and significant behavioral changes to avoid triggering situations.
The patient was initiated on sertraline 25 mg once daily, which was titrated to 50 mg once daily after one week. Additionally, he was prescribed alprazolam 0.25 mg as needed for acute episodes, with instructions to limit its use to avoid dependence. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) was recommended, and arrangements were made for therapy sessions. He was also educated about relaxation techniques, including deep breathing exercises and progressive muscle relaxation, to help manage acute symptoms.
At the 6-week follow-up, the patient reported significant improvement with a reduction in both the frequency and severity of panic episodes. He tolerated sertraline well, with only mild nausea during the initial days of therapy, which resolved spontaneously. Alprazolam use was minimal, and he reported feeling more confident in managing occasional symptoms using relaxation techniques. The follow-up plan included a continuation of sertraline at the current dose, weekly CBT sessions, and regular outpatient visits to monitor progress and assess the need for adjustments in management."
