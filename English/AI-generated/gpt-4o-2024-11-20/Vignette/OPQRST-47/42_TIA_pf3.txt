"A 60-year-old female with a history of hypertension presented with right-sided numbness in her hand and foot along with slurred speech. The symptoms started abruptly one hour prior to arrival at the emergency department and had partially resolved by the time of evaluation. She denied any preceding trauma, headache, vertigo, or visual disturbance. She had no previous history of stroke, TIA, or cardiac disease. She was compliant with her antihypertensive medication but did not regularly monitor her BP at home. There was no history of smoking, alcohol use, or illicit drug use.
On initial examination, her BP was 165/90 mmHg, HR was 78 bpm, RR was 16/min, and body temperature was 36.8°C. Neurological examination revealed mild residual weakness (4+/5) in the right upper and lower extremities, decreased sensation to light touch on the right side, and subtle dysarthria. No facial asymmetry was noted, and no other cranial nerve deficits were apparent. Gait was not assessed due to her weakness. Cardiovascular, respiratory, and abdominal examinations were unremarkable. There were no signs of carotid bruits, and no limb edema or cyanosis was present.
Non-contrast CT of the head showed no evidence of acute infarction, hemorrhage, or mass effect. CTA revealed no significant stenosis or occlusion in the major cerebral vessels but mild atherosclerotic changes in the carotid arteries bilaterally. ECG demonstrated normal sinus rhythm without interval changes, evidence of ischemia, or arrhythmia. Laboratory results revealed total cholesterol of 220 mg/dL, LDL 140 mg/dL, and HDL 42 mg/dL. HbA1c was 6.1%, and fasting glucose was 102 mg/dL. CBC and CMP showed no significant abnormalities. PT/INR and aPTT were within normal limits. A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed normal left ventricular function and no evidence of thrombus or patent foramen ovale.
The patient was diagnosed with TIA likely secondary to large-artery atherosclerosis, given her clinical presentation and imaging findings of bilateral carotid atherosclerosis. Cardioembolic sources were ruled out as no arrhythmias or cardiac abnormalities were identified.
She was started on dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin 81 mg/day and clopidogrel 75 mg/day, along with atorvastatin 40 mg/day for lipid control. Lisinopril 10 mg/day was continued for BP management, and a target BP below 140/90 mmHg was recommended. Lifestyle modifications including a low-saturated-fat diet, regular aerobic exercise, and smoking cessation (though she was a nonsmoker) were advised. Antihypertensive therapy was optimized, and her clinic follow-up was planned for one week.
During her hospital stay, no recurrent neurological symptoms were observed. BP was stable between 130–145/85–90 mmHg. She was discharged on hospital day 2 with instructions to continue her medications and follow up with primary care and neurology for further risk factor modification and monitoring. The importance of medication adherence and timely medical care for any recurrent symptoms was emphasized."
