"A 30-year-old female presented with progressive dysphagia and generalized muscle weakness, particularly affecting the upper and lower extremities, over the past three months. She reported difficulty chewing and swallowing solid foods, accompanied by episodes of choking. She experienced marked fatigue later in the day and noted worsening of symptoms with physical activity. She denied any recent infections, fever, or joint pain. Her medical history was significant for diabetes mellitus, diagnosed five years earlier, which was controlled with metformin 500 mg twice daily. There was no family history of neuromuscular or autoimmune disorders.
On physical examination, the patient displayed bilateral ptosis more prominent on sustained upward gaze. Muscle strength testing revealed significant proximal weakness in both the arms and legs (grade 4/5 on the Medical Research Council scale). Bulbar weakness was evident, with nasal speech and difficulty in swallowing during the bedside water-swallowing test. No sensory deficits were noted, and deep tendon reflexes were intact. There were no signs of muscle atrophy, and cerebellar testing yielded normal results. Vital signs, including respiratory rate and oxygen saturation, were within normal limits at the time of examination.
Laboratory investigations revealed normal CBC, comprehensive metabolic panel, and HbA1c levels consistent with her known diabetic status. Testing for AChR-Ab showed a markedly elevated titer at 12 nmol/L (reference: < 0.4 nmol/L), confirming the presence of circulating autoantibodies. Chest CT was performed to assess for thymic abnormalities and revealed a 2.5 cm anterior mediastinal mass consistent with thymoma. Pulmonary function tests demonstrated a reduction in maximum inspiratory and expiratory pressures but normal FVC, indicating mild respiratory muscle involvement. Electromyography with repetitive nerve stimulation showed a decremental response, supporting the diagnosis of a neuromuscular junction disorder.
The patient was diagnosed with MG associated with thymoma, based on her clinical presentation, positive AChR-Ab, and radiologic findings. Treatment was initiated with pyridostigmine 60 mg QID, which resulted in partial improvement of muscle strength and dysphagia. Due to significant and persistent symptoms, prednisone 20 mg daily was added and gradually titrated to 60 mg daily over two weeks. Concurrently, a thoracic surgeon was consulted for thymectomy, which was performed without complication six weeks after the initial diagnosis. IVIG was administered preoperatively at 1 g/kg daily for two days to stabilize severe symptoms.
Postoperatively, the patient reported marked improvement in bulbar and limb symptoms. Pyridostigmine was tapered to 30 mg TID, and prednisone was gradually reduced to a maintenance dose of 10 mg daily over three months. A repeat chest CT at six months showed no residual mediastinal mass, and her AChR-Ab titer decreased to 2 nmol/L. Follow-up at one year revealed sustained remission of MG symptoms, with continued use of pyridostigmine and low-dose prednisone."
