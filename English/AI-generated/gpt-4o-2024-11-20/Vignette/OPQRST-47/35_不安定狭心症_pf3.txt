"A 68-year-old male presented with chest pain, shortness of breath, and palpitations. Symptoms initially occurred during moderate exertion, such as walking up a flight of stairs, approximately one week prior to presentation. The chest pain was described as a pressure-like sensation localized to the retrosternal region, radiating to his left shoulder and jaw, and persisting for several minutes before resolving with rest. The frequency of these symptoms increased over the following days and eventually occurred at rest one day prior to hospital admission, prompting his visit to the emergency department (ED). He denied recent fever, cough, upper respiratory symptoms, or gastrointestinal complaints and reported no prior history of similar chest discomfort.
The patient had a history of hyperlipidemia managed with lifestyle modifications. He denied a history of smoking, diabetes, hypertension, or coronary artery disease. There was no family history of premature cardiovascular disorders. Medications included over-the-counter multivitamins, and the patient reported no known drug allergies.
On physical examination in the ED, his vital signs revealed a BP of 160/92 mmHg, HR of 92 bpm, and SpO2 of 98% on room air. He appeared anxious but was in no acute distress. Cardiac auscultation revealed normal S1 and S2 sounds without murmurs, rubs, or gallops. His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally, and no peripheral edema or jugular venous distension (JVD) was observed. The resting 12-lead ECG showed ST-segment depression in the inferior leads and T-wave inversions in the lateral leads. However, there were no ST-segment elevations. Troponin I was slightly elevated at 0.08 ng/mL (reference: <0.03 ng/mL), suggestive of myocardial ischemia. Lipid profile drawn during admission showed elevated LDL-C at 156 mg/dL and low HDL-C at 38 mg/dL. A chest X-ray was unremarkable, showing no cardiomegaly or pulmonary congestion.
The clinical presentation, imaging studies, and laboratory findings were consistent with a diagnosis of unstable angina (UA). The patient was promptly started on dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin 325 mg orally and clopidogrel 300 mg orally as a loading dose, followed by 75 mg daily. He also received a heparin infusion (weight-adjusted dose) with close aPTT monitoring to prevent thrombus propagation. Nitroglycerin was initiated via IV infusion at 10 mcg/min to control anginal symptoms and was titrated as needed. Metoprolol tartrate 25 mg orally twice daily was started to manage BP and HR targets. Rosuvastatin 40 mg orally once daily was administered for intensive lipid-lowering therapy.
The patient was admitted to the coronary care unit for further management and underwent coronary angiography within 24 hours of presentation. The angiogram revealed significant stenosis (90%) in the proximal left anterior descending artery without evidence of thrombus. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed with the successful placement of a drug-eluting stent (DES). Post-procedure, the patient was monitored for complications, maintained on DAPT, and started on low-dose enalapril 5 mg daily for secondary prevention.
The patient's symptoms resolved entirely following the intervention. He was discharged on hospital day four with instructions for cardiac rehabilitation, dietary modifications, and strict adherence to guideline-directed medical therapy. A follow-up appointment was scheduled within two weeks for further evaluation and medication adjustment if necessary."
