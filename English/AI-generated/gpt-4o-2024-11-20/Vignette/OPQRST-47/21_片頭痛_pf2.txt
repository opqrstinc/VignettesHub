"An 18-year-old male with a history of migraine presented with a throbbing headache localized to the right temporoparietal region. The headache had started approximately 12 hours earlier and was described as moderate to severe in intensity, rated as 8/10 on a visual analog scale. He reported associated photophobia, phonophobia, and nausea. He also experienced visual disturbances, described as wavy lines and bright spots in his peripheral vision, which began about 30 minutes before the onset of the headache. These visual symptoms resolved within 20 minutes. He denied fever, neck stiffness, or recent upper respiratory symptoms. He reported multiple similar episodes in the past, typically occurring two to three times per month, but described this episode as particularly debilitating. He denied a history of trauma, new medications, substance use, or recent changes in diet or lifestyle.
On physical examination, the patient appeared alert but in mild distress due to his headache. Neurological examination revealed no focal deficits. Cranial nerve function was intact. There was no papilledema on fundoscopy. Motor strength, sensation, and deep tendon reflexes were normal and symmetric. Coordination tests, including finger-to-nose and heel-to-shin, were performed without abnormalities. Gait was steady, and Romberg's test was negative. Cardiovascular and respiratory examinations were unremarkable. There were no meningeal signs noted.
Laboratory tests, including CBC, CMP, and TSH, were within normal limits. ESR and CRP were also unremarkable, excluding significant systemic inflammation. Brain MRI without contrast revealed no structural abnormalities or lesions. Brain MRA ruled out any evidence of vascular disorders such as aneurysms or stenosis. Lumbar puncture was not performed, as there was no clinical suspicion of meningitis or elevated intracranial pressure. The diagnosis of migraine with aura was made based on clinical history and examination, consistent with International Classification of Headache Disorders-3 criteria.
Treatment was initiated for acute symptom management and prophylaxis. For acute relief, the patient was administered sumatriptan 50 mg orally, which resulted in significant headache improvement within two hours. To address his frequent migraines, preventive therapy with propranolol 40 mg BID was started. The patient was also provided with education regarding lifestyle modifications, including maintaining regular sleep patterns, adequate hydration, and identifying and avoiding potential triggers such as caffeine and stress.
At a two-week follow-up, he reported a reduction in the severity and frequency of his migraines. No adverse effects from the medications were reported. Treatment with propranolol was continued, and sumatriptan was prescribed for acute episodes as necessary. Further follow-up was scheduled to assess long-term response and compliance."
