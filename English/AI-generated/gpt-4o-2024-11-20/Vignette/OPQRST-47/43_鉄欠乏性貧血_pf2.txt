"A 45-year-old female presented with complaints of fatigue, shortness of breath, and palpitations that had persisted for the past three months. She reported that her symptoms had gradually worsened over this period, particularly during physical activity. She denied any chest pain, dizziness, weight loss, or changes in bowel habits. There was no history of heavy menstrual bleeding, and she noted that her periods were regular. She denied any dietary restrictions or significant recent changes in her diet. She had no known medical history of chronic illnesses, no history of gastrointestinal symptoms or surgeries, and no use of medications or supplements. There was no family history of anemia or chronic illnesses.
On physical examination, she appeared pale, and her conjunctivae were noted to be pale as well. HR was mildly elevated at 96/min but regular, BP was 118/70 mmHg, and RR was 18/min with no evidence of respiratory distress. There were no murmurs on cardiac auscultation, and lung sounds were clear bilaterally. No edema was observed in her extremities. Abdominal examination was unremarkable, with no tenderness or organomegaly detected.
Initial lab investigations revealed low Hb (9.4 g/dL), low HCT (28%), low MCV (72 fL), and low MCH (22 pg), all indicative of microcytic, hypochromic anemia. Ferritin was significantly reduced at 8 ng/mL. Serum iron was 22 µg/dL, with a decreased TSAT of 8% and elevated TIBC at 430 µg/dL. Vitamin B12 and folate levels were within normal limits. Stool occult blood testing was negative on three separate occasions. Further investigation, including esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy, revealed no evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding, malignancy, or other abnormalities.
Based on her clinical presentation and laboratory findings, a diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia (IDA) was made, likely due to inadequate dietary iron intake. There was no evidence of active blood loss or underlying chronic disease, which suggested that her anemia was primarily caused by a nutritional deficiency.
The patient was started on oral ferrous sulfate 325 mg once daily. She was advised to take the medication with vitamin C to enhance iron absorption and avoid concurrent intake of calcium-containing foods or antacids that could impair absorption. Dietary counseling was provided, emphasizing iron-rich foods such as red meat, poultry, fish, beans, and dark green leafy vegetables.
After four weeks of treatment, she reported an improvement in fatigue and a reduction in palpitations and shortness of breath during exertion. Repeat lab tests showed an increase in Hb to 11.2 g/dL and ferritin to 30 ng/mL. MCV and TSAT also showed improvement. The treatment was continued for an additional three months to replenish iron stores, and regular follow-ups were scheduled. At the six-month follow-up, Hb levels had normalized to 13.4 g/dL, ferritin to 60 ng/mL, and her symptoms had completely resolved. Long-term dietary modifications were reinforced to prevent recurrence."
