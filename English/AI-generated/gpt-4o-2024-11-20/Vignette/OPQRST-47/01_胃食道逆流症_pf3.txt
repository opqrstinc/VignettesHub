"A 60-year-old male presented with a primary complaint of discomfort extending from the throat to the chest. He reported that the symptoms had been present intermittently over the past 3 months, with worsening episodes over the last 2 weeks. The discomfort was described as a burning sensation that occurred primarily after meals and when lying down. He also experienced occasional regurgitation of acidic material into his throat, particularly at night, along with mild nausea. He denied any significant weight loss, hematemesis, or melena. His past medical history included hyperlipidemia managed with atorvastatin, 20 mg daily, and a history of gastric ulcer, which had been treated with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) intermittently in the past. He was a non-smoker and reported no significant alcohol consumption.
On physical examination, his vital signs were within normal limits. There was no evidence of fever, tachycardia, or hypotension. Abdominal examination revealed no tenderness, mass, or organomegaly. Cardiopulmonary examination was unremarkable. There were no signs of cervical lymphadenopathy, and the throat examination showed no erythema or evidence of infection. 
Laboratory investigations, including CBC, CMP, and lipid panel, revealed no significant abnormalities apart from elevated LDL cholesterol, consistent with his history of hyperlipidemia. A urea breath test for *Helicobacter pylori* was negative. An upper GI endoscopy was performed, revealing mild erythema in the distal esophagus but no visible ulcers or erosions. The stomach and duodenum appeared normal. Biopsy samples taken from the esophageal mucosa demonstrated basal cell hyperplasia and elongation of the lamina propria papillae, findings consistent with reflux esophagitis.
The patient was diagnosed with GERD based on his clinical presentation, endoscopic findings, and histological results. 
Treatment was initiated with omeprazole, 20 mg twice daily, for 8 weeks. The patient was counseled on dietary and lifestyle modifications, including avoiding late-night meals, reducing intake of fatty and spicy foods, elevating the head of the bed, and weight management. He was advised to avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs due to their potential to exacerbate his symptoms.
At a follow-up appointment after 8 weeks, the patient reported significant improvement in symptoms, with no episodes of heartburn or regurgitation. A repeat endoscopy was not deemed necessary given the substantial clinical response. He was transitioned to maintenance therapy with omeprazole, 20 mg once daily, and instructed to monitor for any recurrence of symptoms. Additional lipid-lowering therapy was also discussed to optimize management of his hyperlipidemia."
