"A 45-year-old male presented with a chief complaint of pain and numbness in his lower extremities that had persisted for approximately six months. The pain was described as intermittent, burning, and primarily affecting the calves and feet, which often worsened with walking and improved with rest. He also reported occasional cyanosis of the toes and noted that the symptoms progressed over time, impacting his ability to perform daily activities. He denied fever, unintentional weight loss, or systemic symptoms. The patient had no prior significant medical or surgical history. He smoked an average of 20 cigarettes per day for the past 25 years and denied other substance use including alcohol or illicit drugs.
Physical examination revealed cyanosis and diminished pulses in bilateral dorsalis pedis arteries. The skin on his lower legs and feet appeared thin and atrophic with decreased hair growth. Tenderness was elicited on palpation of the calves. Allen's test was positive bilaterally, suggesting compromised collateral circulation. Capillary refill time was prolonged to greater than 3 seconds in all toes. Neurological examination revealed mild hypoesthesia over the affected areas with intact motor strength.
Initial laboratory evaluation, including CBC, CRP, coagulation profile, and basic metabolic panel, was unremarkable. Ankle-brachial index was 0.75 on the right and 0.72 on the left, consistent with moderate arterial occlusion. Lower-extremity arterial duplex ultrasound showed diffuse segmental stenosis and occlusion of the tibial and peroneal arteries without evidence of embolism or significant calcification. Digital subtraction angiography demonstrated a 'corkscrew' appearance of the collateral vessels surrounding the occluded areas, a finding characteristic of thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO). Autoimmune and hypercoagulable workup, including ANA, RF, lupus anticoagulant, and antiphospholipid antibodies, was negative. Imaging studies ruled out proximal arterial stenosis and other vascular etiologies.
The patient was diagnosed with TAO based on his clinical presentation, imaging findings, and smoking history. Smoking cessation was emphasized as the cornerstone of management. The patient was started on nicotine replacement therapy and enrolled in a comprehensive smoking cessation program, including behavioral counseling. Cilostazol 100 mg twice daily was prescribed to improve claudication symptoms by increasing blood flow and reducing platelet aggregation. Low-dose aspirin (81 mg daily) was initiated as an antiplatelet agent to prevent further thrombosis. Pain management involved acetaminophen as needed. The patient was counseled to avoid cold exposure and extremity trauma to reduce the risk of exacerbation.
Over the course of 3 months, the patient demonstrated significant improvement in symptoms with adherence to smoking cessation and medication. Follow-up duplex ultrasound showed no new arterial occlusions, and claudication distance increased substantially. However, mild residual numbness persisted. The patient was strongly encouraged to maintain long-term abstinence from smoking and to continue his prescribed medications and lifestyle modifications."
