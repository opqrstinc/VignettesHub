"A 10-year-old female presented with shortness of breath, nonproductive cough, and chest tightness for the past 3 days. Her symptoms initially began after exposure to a known trigger, including seasonal pollen. The patient reported worsening of symptoms during the nighttime and early morning. She denied fever, recent upper respiratory infections, or contact with individuals with similar complaints. Her past medical history included allergic rhinitis, diagnosed at age 6, with intermittent use of intranasal corticosteroids. She had no history of eczema or food allergies. Family history was significant for asthma in her father and seasonal allergies in her mother. She reported no history of tobacco smoke exposure or recent travel. She had no known drug allergies.
On physical examination, her vital signs revealed a respiratory rate of 28 breaths/min and pulse oximetry of 94% on room air. Her heart rate was 112 bpm, and her temperature was 36.8°C. Her weight and height were within the normal range for her age. Chest auscultation revealed bilateral, diffuse expiratory wheezing, with prolonged expiratory phase. No crackles or stridor were noted. Use of accessory respiratory muscles was evident, and mild nasal flaring was observed. Cardiac and abdominal examinations were unremarkable. Skin examination revealed no rashes or signs of eczema. No lymphadenopathy or clubbing was noted.
Spirometry showed a reduction in FEV1 to 65% of the predicted value, with an FEV1/FVC ratio of 0.7. Post-bronchodilator improvement in FEV1 by 15% was observed after administration of albuterol. Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) measured 35 ppb, indicating airway inflammation. Chest X-ray was unremarkable and lacked evidence of consolidation, hyperinflation, or other abnormalities. Blood tests showed a peripheral eosinophil count of 450/μL. Serum total IgE levels were elevated at 220 IU/mL. Skin-prick testing revealed positive reactions to dust mites and pollen.
The patient was diagnosed with moderate persistent asthma based on clinical presentation, spirometry results, and history of symptoms triggered by known allergens.
She was initiated on inhaled fluticasone propionate 200 mcg BID via a metered-dose inhaler (MDI), combined with a long-acting β2-agonist (LABA), salmeterol 50 mcg BID. A short-acting β2-agonist (SABA), albuterol 90 mcg, was prescribed as needed for symptom relief. Additionally, montelukast 5 mg once daily was prescribed for further control of allergic inflammation. The patient and her caregivers were provided asthma action plans, emphasizing trigger avoidance and correct inhaler technique. Follow-up was scheduled after 4 weeks.
At the 4-week follow-up, the patient reported significant reduction in symptoms, with no nighttime awakenings or use of albuterol in the past week. Repeat spirometry demonstrated an FEV1 increase to 85% of the predicted value. FeNO levels decreased to 20 ppb, and no further wheezing was noted on examination. The current treatment regimen was deemed effective, and she was advised to continue the medications. Further follow-ups were planned every 3 months to monitor disease control and adjust treatment as needed."
