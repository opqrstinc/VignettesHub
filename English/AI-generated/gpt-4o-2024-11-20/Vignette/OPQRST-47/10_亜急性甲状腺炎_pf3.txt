"A 38-year-old male presented with a 2-week history of severe throat pain, which was progressively worsening. He reported accompanying symptoms of fatigue, fever, and unexplained weight loss of approximately 4 kg during this period. There was no history of recent infections or travel, and he denied dysphagia or odynophagia. He described localized anterior neck tenderness, which intensified with swallowing or neck movements. There was no personal or family history of thyroid disease or other significant medical conditions.
On physical examination, he was febrile with a temperature of 38.5°C. His HR was elevated at 110 bpm, and BP was 125/80 mmHg. Examination of the neck revealed an enlarged, tender, and firm thyroid gland, predominantly affecting the right lobe, without overlying erythema. Cervical lymphadenopathy was absent. Cardiac auscultation revealed a regular tachycardic rhythm with no murmurs. Other systemic examinations, including respiratory and abdominal evaluations, were unremarkable.
Laboratory investigations showed elevated ESR at 85 mm/h and CRP at 12 mg/L, suggesting significant inflammation. Thyroid function tests revealed suppressed TSH at <0.01 μIU/mL with elevated free T4 at 4.1 ng/dL and free T3 at 8.0 pg/mL, consistent with a hyperthyroid state. Anti-TPO Ab and TRAb were negative. Thyroglobulin was elevated at 500 ng/mL. CBC revealed mild leukocytosis (12,000/μL) with neutrophil predominance. A thyroid US demonstrated a hypoechoic and irregularly enlarged thyroid gland with areas of decreased vascularity on Doppler imaging. Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) was not performed as the diagnosis was clinically apparent.
The patient was diagnosed with subacute thyroiditis based on the clinical presentation, laboratory abnormalities, and imaging findings. He was started on an initial course of prednisolone at 40 mg per day for 2 weeks to control inflammation and symptoms, followed by a gradual tapering regimen over 4 weeks. Propranolol was initiated at 20 mg twice daily to manage hyperthyroid symptoms, including tachycardia and palpitations.
The patient reported significant symptomatic improvement within 72 hours of initiating corticosteroids. Fever, throat pain, and neck tenderness subsided substantially within the first week of treatment. By the end of the 4-week tapering regimen, thyroid function tests showed normalization of free T3 and T4 levels, with a gradual recovery of TSH. Follow-up US performed at 8 weeks demonstrated resolution of thyroid gland swelling and restoration of normal echogenicity. No relapse of symptoms was noted during the subsequent 3-month observation period."
