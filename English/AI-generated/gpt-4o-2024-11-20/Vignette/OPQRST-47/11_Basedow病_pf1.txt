"A 36-year-old female presented with complaints of palpitations and hand tremors that had progressively worsened over the past three months. She reported increased sweating, heat intolerance, and unintentional weight loss of approximately 8 kg during this period despite a preserved appetite. Fatigue and irritability were also noted, along with occasional difficulty sleeping. There was no significant personal or family medical history, and the patient denied recent illness, medications, or substance use.
On physical examination, her vital signs revealed a HR of 120 bpm, regular rhythm, and BP of 142/88 mmHg. She appeared mildly anxious and restless. An enlarged thyroid gland was palpable and diffusely enlarged without tenderness or nodules. Ophthalmologic assessment showed mild proptosis and lid lag but no conjunctival injection or restriction of extraocular movements. Tremors were observed in outstretched hands, and deep tendon reflexes were brisk. No pretibial myxedema or other cutaneous findings were present.
Laboratory studies revealed elevated FT4 at 35.2 pmol/L and suppressed TSH <0.01 mIU/L, consistent with hyperthyroidism. TSHR-Ab levels were significantly elevated. A radioactive iodine uptake (RAIU) scan demonstrated diffusely increased uptake of 64%, consistent with Graves' disease.
The diagnosis of Gravesâ€™ disease was established based on clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and imaging results. The patient was started on methimazole 15 mg orally once daily as the initial treatment to suppress thyroid hormone synthesis. Propranolol 40 mg orally three times daily was also initiated to control adrenergic symptoms, including tremors and tachycardia.
After one month of treatment, her symptoms showed significant improvement. Palpitations and tremors subsided, and her HR decreased to 80 bpm. Testing at this time showed a drop in FT4 to 18.0 pmol/L, and TSH remained suppressed. Methimazole was continued at the same dose, and regular follow-up was scheduled to monitor thyroid function tests and adjust dosing accordingly. The patient was counseled on potential side effects of methimazole, including agranulocytosis, and advised to report fever or sore throat promptly. Propranolol was tapered as symptoms resolved.
Over the subsequent 6 months, thyroid hormone levels normalized with methimazole, and TSH showed gradual recovery. The patient reported improved quality of life, gained 3 kg of weight, and returned to normal levels of physical activity. Long-term treatment options, including radioactive iodine therapy or surgery, were discussed, but the patient opted to continue antithyroid medication with close monitoring."
