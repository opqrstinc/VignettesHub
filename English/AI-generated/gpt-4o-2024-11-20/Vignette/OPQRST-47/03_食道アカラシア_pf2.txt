"A 32-year-old female presented with a chief complaint of difficulty swallowing food, described as a sensation of food getting stuck in her throat, which had been progressively worsening over the past year. She reported associated episodes of regurgitation of undigested food and occasional vomiting, especially after meals. She described unintentional weight loss of approximately 7 kg over the past six months due to her inability to eat properly. She did not experience chest pain or heartburn but occasionally felt a pressure-like discomfort in her retrosternal region after eating. Her family history and social history were unremarkable, and she denied smoking or alcohol use. Her past medical history was significant only for allergic rhinitis, for which she used intranasal corticosteroids intermittently.
On physical examination, her vital signs were within normal limits, and her BMI was 19.1 kg/mÂ², reflecting her recent weight loss. Abdominal and chest examinations were unremarkable, and there were no findings suggestive of other systemic conditions. Neurological examination, including cranial nerves, was normal, ruling out neuromuscular or central causes of her dysphagia.
To further evaluate her symptoms, a barium esophagram was performed, which revealed a classic bird-beak appearance of the lower esophagus with minimal to no passage of contrast into the stomach. Esophageal manometry demonstrated incomplete relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and a lack of normal esophageal peristalsis, consistent with type II achalasia according to the Chicago Classification. An upper endoscopy was subsequently undertaken to exclude a mechanical obstruction or malignancy; the findings showed retained food in the esophagus and mild esophagitis, but no significant structural abnormalities were revealed. Biopsies taken during endoscopy were unremarkable for eosinophilic esophagitis or malignancy. Routine laboratory investigations, including CBC, CMP, and inflammatory markers, were all within normal limits.
The patient was diagnosed with primary achalasia. She elected to proceed with pharmacologic management initially, given her reluctance to undergo invasive procedures. She was started on a trial of nifedipine, a calcium channel blocker, at 10 mg sublingually before meals to relax the LES and improve symptoms. In addition to pharmacologic therapy, dietary modifications were recommended, including eating soft or liquid meals and avoiding large meals before bedtime. Despite initial relief with nifedipine, her symptoms persisted, prompting a discussion of procedural interventions. She subsequently underwent pneumatic dilation of the esophagus, which significantly improved her swallowing and reduced regurgitation episodes. 
At the 3-month follow-up, she reported marked improvement in her quality of life, with minimal residual symptoms. A repeat barium study showed improved esophageal emptying, indicating the success of the intervention. She was advised to continue follow-up at regular intervals to monitor for potential complications, including recurrent symptoms or esophageal dilation-related perforation.
