"A 63-year-old male presented with a chief complaint of chronic cough, sputum production, and progressive shortness of breath over the past two years. His respiratory symptoms had gradually worsened, particularly during physical activity, with occasional wheezing noted. He denied experiencing chest pain, hemoptysis, or fevers. He had a history of spontaneous pneumothorax 15 years prior, which resolved with conservative management. He was a current smoker with a 40-pack-year history, and he reported significant occupational exposure to dust and chemical irritants. His family history was unremarkable for respiratory diseases. He did not utilize any bronchodilators or inhalers and had not sought previous medical attention for his symptoms.
On physical examination, his vital signs revealed an oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. He appeared thin with slightly labored breathing at rest. Auscultation of the chest revealed decreased breath sounds bilaterally with expiratory wheezing, particularly in the lower lung zones. The presence of hyperresonance on percussion and prolonged expiratory phase was noted. No peripheral edema or jugular venous distension was evident, and his cardiovascular examination showed no significant abnormalities. His BMI was 19.8, and digital clubbing was absent.
Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) revealed a decreased FEV1 of 48% predicted, FVC of 65% predicted, and an FEV1/FVC ratio of 0.54, consistent with moderate airflow obstruction. Post-bronchodilator testing showed minimal reversibility, with an FEV1 improvement of 5%. Arterial blood gases on room air showed a PaO2 of 68 mmHg, PaCO2 of 44 mmHg, and pH of 7.38. A chest X-ray demonstrated hyperinflated lungs with flattening of the diaphragms but no acute infiltrates or masses. CT imaging confirmed diffuse bronchial wall thickening, emphysema predominantly in the upper lobes, and absence of significant scarring or fibrosis. Sputum culture was negative for pathogenic bacteria, and no eosinophilia was observed in peripheral blood counts.
Based on the clinical presentation and diagnostic findings, a diagnosis of COPD, specifically moderate severity according to the GOLD criteria, was established. He was categorized as group B due to his significant symptoms, moderate airflow limitation, and lack of frequent exacerbations.
The patient was initiated on maintenance therapy with a long-acting Î²2-agonist (LABA) and a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) combination therapy, specifically indacaterol 27.5 mcg combined with glycopyrrolate 15.6 mcg via inhaler, administered twice daily. Smoking cessation counseling and nicotine replacement therapy were provided. Influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations were updated. Pulmonary rehabilitation involving structured aerobic and strength training exercises was recommended. During follow-up after 6 weeks, the patient reported improved exercise tolerance and decreased dyspnea. His PFT parameters showed modest improvement. Smoking cessation was successfully achieved, verified by exhaled CO monitoring. While no exacerbations occurred during this period, he was advised to return promptly in case of symptom worsening and to adhere rigorously to maintenance treatment."
