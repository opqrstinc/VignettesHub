"A 38-year-old male presented with a chief complaint of episodic palpitations, headaches, and diaphoresis that had been occurring for eight months. These episodes were often associated with a feeling of anxiety and occurred approximately three to four times per week, each lasting 20-30 minutes. He also reported a history of sustained hypertension, with BP readings typically measuring around 160/100 mmHg during routine checks, but no antihypertensive medications had been initiated. There was no history of significant weight loss, fever, chest pain, or syncope. He denied any past medical conditions or family history of hypertension or other endocrine disorders. 
On physical examination, his BP was 168/102 mmHg, and HR was noted to be 115 bpm in a resting state. He appeared anxious but was oriented and cooperative. Cardiovascular and respiratory examinations were unremarkable, and there were no murmurs, bruits, or rales. Skin was dry with no hyperpigmentation or striae; there was no evidence of a palpable abdominal mass or peripheral edema. Fundoscopic examination was normal, without hypertensive retinopathy changes. Neurological findings were intact, and there was no tremor.
Initial laboratory investigations revealed normal renal and hepatic function, and blood glucose was within normal limits. TSH and free T4 levels were normal. Serum electrolytes showed no abnormalities in potassium or sodium. Plasma-free metanephrines were significantly elevated at 738 pg/mL (normal <65 pg/mL), and urinary fractionated metanephrines over 24 hours were also markedly elevated at 1.84 mg (normal <0.9 mg/day). A 24-hour urine catecholamine test showed elevated norepinephrine at 220 µg/day (normal <80 µg/day). Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a 3.2 cm hypervascular adrenal mass on the right side, consistent with the features of pheochromocytoma. No evidence of metastasis or lymph node involvement was noted. MIBG scintigraphy confirmed increased uptake in the adrenal lesion without any additional abnormal accumulation in other regions.
The patient was diagnosed with a right adrenal pheochromocytoma. Preoperative preparation included alpha-adrenergic blockade with phenoxybenzamine started at 10 mg orally twice daily, which was titrated to 20 mg three times daily over two weeks, aiming for BP stabilization below 130/85 mmHg in a seated position without orthostatic hypotension. After achieving adequate alpha-blockade, a beta-adrenergic blocker, propranolol, was introduced at 10 mg orally three times daily for HR control. Oral fluids and a high-sodium diet were recommended to prevent hypovolemia.
Surgical intervention was performed via laparoscopic right adrenalectomy. The procedure was uneventful, and BP was monitored closely in the perioperative period. Postoperatively, his BP normalized, recorded at 118/76 mmHg without the need for antihypertensive therapy. Plasma-free metanephrines and urinary catecholamines were remeasured six weeks after surgery and were within normal ranges. Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma, with no evidence of malignant features. At a follow-up of six months, he remained normotensive and symptom-free."
