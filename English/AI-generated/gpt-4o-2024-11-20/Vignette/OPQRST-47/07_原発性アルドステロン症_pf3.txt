"A 38-year-old male presented with a chief complaint of persistent hypertension and nocturnal polyuria. He reported a 2-year history of elevated BP, which was initially detected during a routine health checkup. Over the past year, he noticed worsening BP control despite adherence to a low-sodium diet and regular exercise. Additionally, he experienced increasing episodes of nocturia, occurring 3–4 times per night, which disrupted his sleep. He denied any symptoms of headache, chest pain, or palpitations. His medical history was significant for nephrolithiasis managed conservatively two years prior. There was no history of diabetes, thyroid disease, or chronic kidney disease. He was not currently on any medications. His family history was unremarkable for endocrine or renal disorders.
On physical examination, his BP was 156/94 mmHg in the right arm in a seated position, measured on two separate occasions. His heart rate was 78 bpm and regular. There was no evidence of peripheral edema, abdominal tenderness, or palpable masses. Cardiac and pulmonary auscultation were unremarkable. Neurological examination revealed no focal deficits, and a fundoscopic exam did not show hypertensive retinopathy changes.
Initial blood work revealed Na 144 mmol/L, K 2.8 mmol/L, and serum Cr 0.78 mg/dL, suggesting hypokalemia without renal impairment. Serum aldosterone concentration (PAC) was elevated at 29 ng/dL, with a suppressed plasma renin activity (PRA) of 0.2 ng/mL/hr, yielding an aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR) of 145. A 24-hour urinary aldosterone excretion was also elevated at 16 μg/day, indicative of mineralocorticoid excess. A CT scan of the abdomen showed a 1.5 cm hypodense nodule in the left adrenal gland without evidence of local invasion or metastasis, suggestive of an adrenal adenoma. ECG demonstrated no significant abnormalities, such as arrhythmias or LVH.
Based on the clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and imaging results, the patient was diagnosed with primary aldosteronism due to an aldosterone-producing adenoma. Subtype evaluation confirmed unilateral disease, and further management planning ensued.
The patient was started on spironolactone, a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, at a dose of 25 mg daily. Over two weeks, the dosage was titrated to 50 mg daily, leading to a gradual reduction in BP and normalization of serum K levels (4.2 mmol/L). No significant adverse effects, including gynecomastia, were observed. Given the patient's excellent response to medical therapy and his preference, surgical management was deferred, and he opted for continued pharmacological treatment.
During a follow-up visit three months later, his BP had improved to 132/82 mmHg, and nocturia episodes decreased to once nightly. Repeat blood work showed stable electrolytes and renal function. The treatment plan included indefinite spironolactone therapy, lifestyle modifications, and regular monitoring to assess for potential disease progression or complications."
