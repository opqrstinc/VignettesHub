"A 75-year-old male presented with a chief complaint of progressive memory loss and episodes of getting lost in familiar locations. His symptoms began insidiously approximately two years prior to presentation. Initially, he experienced occasional difficulty recalling recently learned information, which gradually progressed to forgetting appointments and misplacing common objects. Over the past six months, his family reported significant worsening, including his inability to find his way home from familiar places and a noticeable decline in speech fluency, characterized by word-finding difficulties during conversations. There was no history of head trauma or substance abuse. His past medical history included hypertension and diabetes mellitus, both managed with medications.
On physical examination, he appeared alert but demonstrated mild disorientation to time. Neurological examination revealed no focal neurological deficits. Cranial nerves were intact, motor strength was 5/5 in all extremities, and reflexes were normal. However, cognitive assessment using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) yielded a score of 21/30, with deficits in immediate recall, attention, and visuospatial skills.
Further diagnostic workup included brain MRI, which demonstrated bilateral hippocampal atrophy, particularly in the medial temporal lobes, consistent with neurodegeneration. No evidence of vascular abnormalities or significant white matter changes was seen. FDG-PET imaging was performed, revealing reduced glucose metabolism in the bilateral parietal and temporal regions. Laboratory testing for reversible causes of cognitive decline, including TSH, vit B12, and folate levels, was within normal limits. Genetic testing was not performed since there was no known family history of dementia. CSF analysis demonstrated decreased AÎ²42 levels and an elevated tau protein ratio, supportive of AD.
Based on the clinical history, examination findings, and diagnostic studies, a diagnosis of probable AD was established.
Treatment was initiated with donepezil at a starting dose of 5 mg once daily, which was increased to 10 mg after one month. Memantine was added later in the treatment course at an initial dose of 5 mg once daily, titrated to 10 mg twice daily over several weeks. The patient was also educated about lifestyle modifications, such as engaging in cognitive stimulation activities and regular physical exercise, to potentially slow cognitive decline. His family was counseled on the progressive nature of the disease, and resources for caregiver support were provided.
Six months after initiating treatment, the patient demonstrated modest stabilization in cognitive function, with family members reporting fewer episodes of disorientation and an improved ability to maintain simple daily routines. His MMSE score remained stable at 21/30 during the follow-up visit. No significant adverse effects from donepezil or memantine were reported, aside from mild gastrointestinal discomfort during the first week of donepezil initiation, which resolved spontaneously."
