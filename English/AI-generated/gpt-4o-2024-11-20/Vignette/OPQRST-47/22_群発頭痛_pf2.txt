"A 50-year-old male presented with severe unilateral headaches localized to the right periorbital and temporal regions. The headaches had started 10 days prior to his visit, recurring in clusters up to eight times daily, each lasting around 45 minutes. He described the pain as excruciatingly sharp and stabbing, rating it as 10/10 in intensity. The headaches typically occurred at the same time of day, often waking him from sleep at night. He reported associated symptoms, including right-sided nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, conjunctival injection, and right eyelid swelling during the attacks. He denied photophobia, phonophobia, aura, or nausea that might suggest a migraine. His past medical history included well-controlled hypertension, and he denied any recent infections or trauma. There was no family history of headaches.
Physical examination during the visit was unremarkable aside from findings observed during an induced attack. During the episode in the clinic, the patient exhibited ipsilateral ptosis, mild myosis, and conjunctival injection of the right eye. Rhinorrhea and right-sided nasal obstruction were also observed. Neurological and fundoscopic examinations were otherwise normal. Vital signs were stable, and there was no evidence of systemic infection or other abnormalities. Signs of secondary causes of headache, such as papilledema or focal neurological deficits, were absent.
A thorough diagnostic workup was performed to rule out secondary causes of headache. Brain MRI with and without contrast showed no abnormalities suggestive of intracranial lesions, masses, or vascular malformations. MR angiography was also negative for aneurysms or arterial dissection. Laboratory evaluations, including CBC, ESR, CRP, and comprehensive metabolic panel, were within normal limits. Lumbar puncture was not performed, given the lack of red flag symptoms or evidence of increased ICP.
The clinical history and examination findings were consistent with a diagnosis of cluster headache, a primary headache disorder. The patient met the ICHD-3 diagnostic criteria for cluster headache, including the characteristic temporospatial pattern of attacks and autonomic symptoms.
Treatment was initiated with sumatriptan 6 mg subcutaneously, which provided rapid and effective relief within 10 minutes of administration. Oxygen therapy at a flow rate of 12 L/min via a non-rebreather mask was also prescribed for home use to manage subsequent attacks, as it provided symptom improvement during clinic observation. For prophylaxis, the patient was started on verapamil at a dose of 240 mg/day, which was gradually titrated upward over several weeks to a maintenance dose of 480 mg/day, based on clinical response and tolerability. ECG monitoring was performed during dose escalation to monitor for potential PR interval prolongation. The patient was instructed to avoid known triggers such as alcohol.
At a 4-week follow-up visit, the patient reported a significant reduction in attack frequency, experiencing only one to two less severe attacks weekly. Oxygen and sumatriptan remained effective as abortive therapies. He tolerated verapamil well, with no reported side effects or ECG abnormalities. Adjustments to the prophylactic regimen were deemed unnecessary at that time."
