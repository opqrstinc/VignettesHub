"A 65-year-old male with a history of COPD presented with a 3-month history of persistent cough, unintentional weight loss of approximately 10 kg, and progressive fatigue. The cough was non-productive and not associated with hemoptysis. He reported worsening dyspnea on exertion but denied fever, chest pain, or night sweats. He had a 40-pack-year history of smoking but quit 10 years prior. There was no occupational exposure to asbestos or other significant carcinogens.
On physical examination, decreased breath sounds and dullness to percussion were noted in the right lower lung field. Inspiratory crackles were heard bilaterally, predominantly on the right side. There was no lymphadenopathy, cyanosis, or clubbing of the fingers. Vital signs were within normal limits, and oxygen saturation on room air was 92%.
CXR revealed a 4.5-cm irregular mass in the right lower lobe with associated mediastinal widening. CT of the chest with contrast confirmed the presence of a 4.6 x 4.2-cm spiculated mass in the right lower lobe, accompanied by right hilar enlargement and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. PET-CT demonstrated increased FDG uptake in the primary lesion (SUV max 12.5) and mediastinal nodes, suspicious for malignancy. PFTs showed a moderate obstructive pattern consistent with COPD, with an FEV1/FVC ratio of 56%. Laboratory tests revealed elevated LDH and normal calcium levels. A CT-guided core needle biopsy of the pulmonary mass was performed, and histopathological examination demonstrated poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. EGFR mutation testing and ALK rearrangement were negative, while PD-L1 expression was high (TPS > 50%).
The final diagnosis was stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), adenocarcinoma subtype. Due to the PD-L1 expression level, the patient was initiated on pembrolizumab monotherapy at a dose of 200 mg IV every 3 weeks as a first-line treatment. He tolerated the therapy without severe adverse effects, except for mild fatigue. 
Re-evaluation with repeat imaging after three cycles showed a significant reduction in the size of the primary tumor and mediastinal lymph nodes. The patient reported subjective improvement in symptoms, with decreased cough and improved energy levels. Treatment was continued, and maintenance therapy was planned based on clinical and radiographic response."
