"A 38-year-old female presented with a chief complaint of pain in her hands and feet, accompanied by ulcer formation on her fingers and toes. The symptoms began insidiously approximately 6 months prior to presentation, with intermittent pain in the distal extremities, initially triggered by cold exposure. Over time, the pain worsened and became persistent, significantly impacting her daily activities. She reported the development of digital ulcers 3 months prior, which had not healed and were associated with occasional bleeding. She denied fever, weight loss, or other systemic symptoms. There was no history of smoking cessation, though she admitted to smoking one pack per day since the age of 18. She denied alcohol consumption or illicit drug use. Her family and medical histories were unremarkable.
On physical examination, necrotic ulcerations were observed on the tips of her second and third fingers of the right hand, as well as the first and second toes of her right foot. Surrounding skin was erythematous with slight edema. Peripheral pulses, including radial, ulnar, posterior tibial, and dorsalis pedis arteries, were markedly diminished on palpation bilaterally. Capillary refill was delayed in both hands and feet. Allen’s test demonstrated a prolonged refill time, indicating impaired arterial blood flow. There was no evidence of cyanosis in proximal extremities, and the cardiovascular and respiratory examinations were otherwise unremarkable.
Laboratory testing revealed Hb of 12.5 g/dL, WBC count of 7,500/µL, and PLT count of 220,000/µL. CRP and ESR were mildly elevated at 15 mg/L and 30 mm/hr, respectively. ANA testing was negative, and RF was within normal limits. BUN, creatinine, and LFTs were unremarkable. Vascular imaging, including arterial Doppler US of the upper and lower limbs, revealed segmental narrowing of the radial and ulnar arteries, as well as the tibial and peroneal arteries, without evidence of atherosclerotic plaques or large-vessel thrombosis. Angiography confirmed the presence of “corkscrew” collaterals, consistent with distal microvascular involvement.
The patient was diagnosed with thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO), also known as Buerger’s disease, based on her clinical presentation, imaging findings, and strong smoking history.
Treatment focused on immediate smoking cessation, which was deemed critical to preventing disease progression. She was started on nicotine replacement therapy in the form of a transdermal patch, delivering 21 mg/day, alongside nicotine gum for breakthrough cravings. Cilostazol 100 mg twice daily was initiated to improve peripheral circulation. Low-dose aspirin at 81 mg/day was prescribed to reduce thrombus formation. Consideration was given to iloprost infusion, but it was deferred due to logistical challenges and her initial hesitancy. Pain management included acetaminophen 500 mg as needed, and wound care was initiated with regular cleansing and application of non-adhesive dressings.
Over the following months, the patient demonstrated partial healing of her ulcers, with notable pain reduction and increased functional mobility in her hands and feet. Smoking cessation was achieved within 2 weeks, as confirmed by follow-up cotinine levels. Repeat vascular imaging showed slight improvement in collateral development and perfusion."
