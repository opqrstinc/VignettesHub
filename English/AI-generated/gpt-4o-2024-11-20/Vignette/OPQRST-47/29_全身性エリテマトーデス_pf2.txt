"A 17-year-old female presented with a one-month history of fever, generalized fatigue, and intermittent joint pain involving the small joints of the hands and wrists. She also noted a non-itchy, erythematous rash across her cheeks and nasal bridge, exacerbated by sun exposure. There was no history of photosensitivity, weight loss, or Raynaud’s phenomenon prior to this episode. She denied any other dermatologic, neurologic, or systemic symptoms. Her medical history was otherwise unremarkable, and she was not on any medication. Family history was non-contributory.  
On physical examination, she appeared fatigued and febrile with a temperature of 38.5°C. A well-demarcated erythematous malar rash was present without involvement of the nasolabial folds. Mild swelling and tenderness were noted in the metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints bilaterally. There was no synovial effusion or deformity. Cardiovascular, pulmonary, abdominal, and neurological examinations were unremarkable. There was no evidence of alopecia, oral ulcers, or lymphadenopathy.  
Laboratory findings revealed anemia (Hb 9.8 g/dL), leucopenia (WBC 2.5 × 10⁹/L), and thrombocytopenia (platelets 110 × 10⁹/L). Inflammatory markers were elevated, with an ESR of 67 mm/hr and CRP of 15 mg/L. Renal function tests showed an elevated serum creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL with proteinuria (1.5 g/24 hours) and microscopic hematuria. ANA was positive at a titer of 1:640 with a homogenous pattern. Anti-dsDNA antibodies were elevated at 178 IU/mL, and complement levels were decreased (C3 62 mg/dL, C4 10 mg/dL). APL antibodies, including anti-cardiolipin and lupus anticoagulant, were negative. A renal biopsy demonstrated diffuse lupus nephritis (class IV) on histopathology. Imaging, including chest X-ray and abdominal ultrasound, showed no abnormalities.    
Based on clinical features, laboratory findings, and histopathological confirmation, a diagnosis of SLE with renal involvement was made. She was initiated on high-dose prednisone 1 mg/kg/day (60 mg daily) in combination with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) at 3 g/day. Hydroxychloroquine 400 mg daily was also started for systemic control, along with calcium and vitamin D supplements for bone health. Antihypertensive therapy was initiated with lisinopril 10 mg/day to manage proteinuria.  
Over the following weeks, her symptoms gradually improved. Fever resolved, and the joint pain diminished significantly. Repeat laboratory evaluations after two months showed normalization of renal function tests, improvement in complement levels, and reduction of proteinuria to 500 mg/day. Steroid tapering was initiated, reducing prednisone by 5 mg every two weeks, targeting a maintenance dose of 10 mg daily. MMF and hydroxychloroquine were continued. At a six-month follow-up, the patient achieved clinical remission with complete resolution of symptoms and stabilization of laboratory parameters. Regular follow-ups were planned to monitor for potential flares and long-term complications."
