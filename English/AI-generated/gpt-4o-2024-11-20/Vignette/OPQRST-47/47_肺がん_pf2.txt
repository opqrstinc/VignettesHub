"A 55-year-old female presented with progressive dyspnea and a persistent non-productive cough over the past three months. She described occasional wheezing and unintentional weight loss of approximately 7 kg during this period. She denied fever, hemoptysis, or chest pain. She had no significant past medical history, no personal or familial history of malignancy, and no occupational exposure to known carcinogens. Her social history included a 30 pack-year smoking habit, having recently quit smoking one year prior to symptom onset.
On physical examination, the patient appeared mildly dyspneic but in no acute distress. Breath sounds were decreased in the right upper lobe, accompanied by dullness to percussion in the same region. No wheezing, stridor, or rales were noted. Clubbing of the fingers was absent, and there were no palpable lymph nodes in the cervical or supraclavicular regions. Cardiac, abdominal, and neurologic examinations were unremarkable.
Initial laboratory investigations showed no abnormalities in routine CBC, serum electrolytes, kidney function, and liver enzymes. A CXR revealed a right upper lobe mass with associated hilar lymphadenopathy. CT of the chest confirmed a 4.2 cm spiculated lesion in the right upper lobe with evidence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy. PET-CT demonstrated increased FDG uptake in the primary lesion (SUVmax 11.5) and the mediastinal nodes, suggesting possible metastasis. Sputum cytology was inconclusive. Bronchoscopy with biopsy was performed, and histopathological examination revealed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, confirmed by immunohistochemical staining as TTF-1 and Napsin A positive. Molecular testing identified an EGFR exon 19 deletion mutation.
The patient was diagnosed with Stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), adenocarcinoma subtype. Multidisciplinary discussions favored a combination of systemic targeted therapy and radiation, given her EGFR mutation and localized node involvement. She initiated treatment with erlotinib 150 mg PO once daily. Concurrently, she received a total radiation dose of 60 Gy delivered in 30 fractions to the primary tumor and involved nodes. Treatment was well-tolerated with minimal toxicities, including grade 1 rash and mild diarrhea managed with topical hydrocortisone and loperamide.
At two months follow-up, her symptoms of dyspnea and cough had significantly improved, and repeat imaging showed a partial response with substantial tumor shrinkage and resolution of FDG uptake in mediastinal nodes. The treatment plan included continuation of erlotinib with regular imaging and clinical assessments every three months. The patient remained in good performance status without evidence of disease progression during six months of follow-up."
