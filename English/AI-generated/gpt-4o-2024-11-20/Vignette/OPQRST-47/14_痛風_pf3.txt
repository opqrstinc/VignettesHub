"A 38-year-old male presented with a sudden onset of severe pain, swelling, and redness in his right foot, specifically localized to the 1st metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint. The symptoms began approximately 12 hours prior to presentation and were described as debilitating, rendering him unable to bear weight on the affected foot. He reported no history of trauma or preceding physical activity. He denied fever, chills, or other systemic symptoms. There was no significant past medical history, including no prior episodes of joint pain, and he denied a family history of rheumatologic or metabolic disorders.
On physical examination, the patient appeared to be in significant distress due to pain. The right 1st MTP joint was markedly erythematous, swollen, warm to the touch, and exquisitely tender to palpation, with a limited range of motion. There was no evidence of joint deformity, overlying skin changes suggestive of chronic arthritis, or involvement of other joints. No tophi were observed on physical examination. Vitals were within normal limits, and no signs of systemic inflammation, infection, or constitutional symptoms were noted.
Laboratory analysis revealed an elevated serum uric acid level of 8.9 mg/dL. WBC count was mildly elevated at 12,300/μL with a neutrophilic predominance. CRP and ESR were also significantly elevated. A synovial fluid analysis was performed via arthrocentesis. The aspirated fluid was yellow and cloudy, with elevated leukocyte counts (75,000/μL, predominantly neutrophils) and the presence of negatively birefringent, needle-shaped crystals under polarized light microscopy, consistent with monosodium urate crystals. Synovial fluid culture was negative for bacterial growth.
Based on the clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and synovial fluid analysis, the patient was diagnosed with acute gouty arthritis involving the right 1st MTP joint.
Management included the administration of oral colchicine at a loading dose of 1.2 mg, followed by 0.6 mg one hour later, and continued at 0.6 mg twice daily for prophylaxis. Additionally, oral naproxen 500 mg twice daily was initiated for inflammation and pain management. The patient was advised to avoid foods high in purine content and alcohol and was encouraged to maintain adequate hydration. He was also educated about the importance of follow-up for monitoring serum urate levels and the potential need for long-term urate-lowering therapy.
Within 48 hours of initiating treatment, the patient's pain and swelling significantly improved, allowing him to bear weight on the affected foot. By day 5, symptoms had largely resolved, and the patient reported no recurrence of pain. He was discharged with a plan for outpatient follow-up, including further assessment of his uric acid levels to determine the need for maintenance therapy with allopurinol or febuxostat."
