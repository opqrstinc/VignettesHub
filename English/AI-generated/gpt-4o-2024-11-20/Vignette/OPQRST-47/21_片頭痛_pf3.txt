"A 19-year-old female presented with a 48-hour history of severe, throbbing, and unilateral headache located on the left side. The headache was associated with nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and osmophobia. She reported that the pain worsened with physical activity, such as walking. She described a similar pattern of headaches occurring 2-3 times per month over the past two years, which had significantly impaired her daily activities and academic performance. She denied any aura, recent illness, fever, or signs of infection. Her history was consistent with recurrent migraines. She reported occasional use of OTC analgesics, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen, with limited relief. No recent medication changes, trauma, or significant stressors were identified.
On physical examination, her vital signs were within normal limits, with no fever or hemodynamic instability. Neurological examination was unremarkable, including normal strength, sensation, coordination, and reflexes. There were no focal neurological deficits, cranial nerve abnormalities, or evidence of meningeal irritation (e.g., Brudzinski’s or Kernig’s signs were absent). Fundoscopic examination showed no papilledema. The remainder of the general physical examination was unremarkable.
Laboratory tests, including CBC, electrolytes, renal function, and liver function tests, were within normal ranges. ESR and CRP were also unremarkable. A CT scan of the brain was performed to exclude secondary causes of headache, such as intracranial hemorrhage or mass lesion, and findings were normal. MRI was not indicated at this time given the clinical picture and absence of red flags suggesting an alternative diagnosis. An EEG was also deemed unnecessary due to the absence of seizure-like symptoms.
Based on the clinical history, recurrent pattern, exclusion of secondary causes, and supportive physical examination findings, the diagnosis of migraine without aura was made.
Acute treatment with sumatriptan 50 mg orally was initiated, with significant improvement in her headache within two hours. To manage recurrent episodes, prophylactic treatment with topiramate 25 mg nightly was started, with plans to titrate the dose to 100 mg nightly over four weeks. She was counseled on lifestyle modifications, including stress management, proper sleep hygiene, hydration, and avoidance of known migraine triggers such as caffeine, alcohol, and prolonged screen exposure. She was advised to maintain a headache diary to monitor the frequency, duration, and severity of episodes, as well as potential triggers.
At the two-week follow-up, the patient reported a significant reduction in headache frequency and severity. She tolerated both sumatriptan and topiramate without adverse effects. She will continue to follow up regularly to adjust treatment as needed and assess her response to prophylactic therapy."
