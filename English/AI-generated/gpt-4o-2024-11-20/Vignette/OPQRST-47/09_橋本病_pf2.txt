"A 37-year-old male presented with complaints of persistent fatigue and constipation for the past five months. He described the fatigue as progressively worsening, significantly affecting his daily activities and ability to perform at work. Additionally, he reported experiencing increased intolerance to cold, mild weight gain despite no reported changes in diet or physical activity, and dry skin. There was no accompanying history of depression, neck pain, or dysphagia. He denied a personal or family history of thyroid disease, autoimmune conditions, or significant prior medical concerns.
On physical examination, his vital signs revealed a resting BP of 128/82 mmHg, HR of 58 bpm, and a BMI of 29.2. His skin appeared dry with some coarse texture, and there was mild periorbital puffiness. Neck examination showed a firm and slightly enlarged thyroid gland with no tenderness or palpable nodules. There were no clinical signs of hyperthyroidism, including no tremor, exophthalmos, or tachycardia. Cardiopulmonary and abdominal examinations were otherwise unremarkable.
Laboratory investigations revealed elevated TSH at 8.9 μU/mL (reference range: 0.45–4.5 μU/mL) with low free T4 at 0.6 ng/dL (reference range: 0.8–1.8 ng/dL), consistent with primary hypothyroidism. Anti-TPO antibodies were markedly elevated at 212 IU/mL, and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies were also elevated at 89 IU/mL, consistent with an autoimmune etiology. CBC showed mild normocytic anemia (Hb 12.8 g/dL), and CMP was unremarkable except for a mildly elevated cholesterol level (LDL 144 mg/dL). US of the thyroid revealed diffusely hypoechoic and heterogenous glandular tissue without focal nodules or signs of malignancy.
The patient was diagnosed with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, the most common cause of hypothyroidism in this demographic, based on clinical presentation, abnormal thyroid function tests, elevated thyroid autoantibodies, and supportive imaging findings.
He was initiated on levothyroxine at a starting dose of 75 mcg daily, with instructions to take the medication on an empty stomach 30 minutes before breakfast for optimal absorption. He was advised to follow up after six weeks for repeat TSH and free T4 levels to assess adequacy of replacement therapy. He was also counseled on the potential need for lifelong thyroid hormone replacement therapy and educated on recognizing symptoms of over- or under-replacement, including palpitations, weight changes, or recurrent fatigue.
At the six-week follow-up, his TSH reduced to 3.1 μU/mL, and his free T4 normalized to 1.2 ng/dL, indicating an adequate response to treatment. Subjectively, he reported significant improvement in energy levels, a reversal of the constipation, and an overall sense of well-being. He was maintained on the same dose, with plans for monitoring TSH annually and adjustments as required based on clinical and laboratory findings."
