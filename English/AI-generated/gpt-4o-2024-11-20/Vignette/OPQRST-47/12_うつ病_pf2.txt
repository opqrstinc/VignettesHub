"A 34-year-old female presented with persistent fatigue and loss of appetite for approximately six months. She reported that the symptoms had gradually worsened over this period, leading to difficulty maintaining her daily activities and reduced work performance. She described a pervasive low mood, difficulty concentrating, and frequent feelings of worthlessness, particularly in the early mornings. She denied any specific precipitating factors but acknowledged increasing interpersonal conflicts and feelings of isolation. Sleep disturbances were also reported, with difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep, accompanied by early morning awakenings. She denied suicidal ideation or plans but expressed feelings of hopelessness about her future. There was no reported history of substance use, significant weight changes, recent infections, or other medical issues except for a history of IBS.
On physical examination, the patient appeared fatigued, with a flat affect and reduced engagement during the interview. Vital signs were within normal ranges, and there were no abnormalities detected on cardiovascular, respiratory, abdominal, or neurological examinations. There were no signs of psychomotor agitation or retardation. No physical findings suggested an alternative organic cause for her symptoms.
Laboratory investigations were conducted to exclude potential medical causes for her symptoms. CBC, CMP, TSH, and ferritin levels were all within normal limits. Vit B12 and folate levels showed no deficiencies. A urinalysis and a toxicology screen were unremarkable. Imaging studies, including brain MRI, were not deemed necessary based on the clinical presentation and lack of focal neurological symptoms. A PHQ-9 questionnaire was administered, which yielded a score of 19, indicative of moderately severe depression.
Based on the clinical presentation, duration of symptoms, and absence of identifiable medical or traumatic causes, a diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD), as defined by DSM-5 criteria, was established. The diagnosis was further supported by the patient's self-reported symptoms of anhedonia, low energy, difficulties concentrating, and feelings of worthlessness, persisting for more than two weeks and negatively impacting her occupational and social functioning.
Treatment was initiated with sertraline at a starting dose of 50 mg once daily. Psychoeducation was provided regarding the nature of depression and the role of medication and psychotherapy. She was also referred for cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to address maladaptive thought patterns and improve coping strategies. Regular follow-up visits were scheduled to monitor treatment response, medication tolerability, and any potential adverse effects.
At the two-week follow-up, she reported mild nausea and headache, which were attributed to sertraline initiation. These side effects subsided by the fourth week of treatment. Over the subsequent six weeks, her mood, energy levels, and sleep quality gradually improved. By the three-month follow-up, PHQ-9 scoring revealed significant improvement, with a reduction to a score of 8, indicating mild depressive symptoms. She demonstrated improved functionality in her daily activities and reported better engagement with friends and colleagues, though she continued CBT to further enhance coping mechanisms and build resilience."
