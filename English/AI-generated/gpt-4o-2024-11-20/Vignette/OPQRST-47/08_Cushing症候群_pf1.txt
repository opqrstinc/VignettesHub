"A 45-year-old male presented with progressive rounding of the face and unintentional weight gain over the past 8 months. He reported increased fat deposition in the abdominal region and proximal muscle weakness, making it difficult for him to climb stairs or lift objects. He also noted easy bruising and purple striae on the abdomen. His medical history included type 2 DM and HTN, both managed with oral medications. He denied any recent changes in his medications or lifestyle, and his FH was unremarkable for endocrine disorders.
On physical examination, he had central obesity with a BMI of 34.1 kg/m². His face appeared round and plethoric, consistent with a ""moon face."" There were prominent dorsocervical and supraclavicular fat pads, often referred to as a ""buffalo hump."" Examination revealed violaceous striae over the abdomen, measuring approximately 1 cm in width. There were scattered ecchymoses on both forearms without any history of recent trauma. His BP was elevated at 152/96 mmHg. There was no palpable thyroid gland enlargement or proximal lymphadenopathy. No overt hirsutism or skin infections were identified, and his neurological exam showed proximal muscle weakness with diminished strength in the upper and lower extremities.
Laboratory tests revealed hyperglycemia with fasting glucose of 156 mg/dL and HbA1c of 7.1%. His serum Na was elevated at 146 mmol/L, and serum K was low at 3.2 mmol/L. Morning cortisol levels were found to be elevated at 29 µg/dL, and there was a loss of diurnal cortisol variation, with elevated levels in the evening. A low-dose dexamethasone suppression test failed to suppress cortisol (cortisol post-dexamethasone: 21 µg/dL). A subsequent ACTH level was elevated at 67 pg/mL, indicating an ACTH-dependent cause of hypercortisolism. MRI of the pituitary showed a 4 mm hypoenhancing lesion suggestive of a microadenoma. Imaging of the adrenal glands via CT showed no abnormalities, ruling out an adrenal etiology.
The diagnosis of ACTH-dependent Cushing syndrome, secondary to a pituitary microadenoma, was made. The patient underwent medical management with metyrapone 750 mg/day in divided doses initially to reduce hypercortisolism. This was later titrated up to 1250 mg/day based on clinical response and biochemical monitoring. BP was controlled with lisinopril 20 mg once daily, and his glycemic control was optimized with metformin 1000 mg twice daily. 
Two months after initiation of medical therapy, the patient underwent transsphenoidal surgical resection of the pituitary microadenoma. Postoperatively, his serum cortisol levels normalized, and ACTH levels decreased, indicating successful removal of the tumor. He experienced gradual resolution of the facial rounding and weight gain. He was monitored post-surgery with periodic serum cortisol and ACTH levels, as well as MRI surveillance. Hydrocortisone replacement therapy (20 mg/day in divided doses) was started immediately postoperatively given the risk of adrenal insufficiency, and it was tapered off over 6 months as endogenous adrenal function recovered. His DM and HTN showed marked improvement, and he was ultimately maintained on a reduced dose of antihypertensive medication."
