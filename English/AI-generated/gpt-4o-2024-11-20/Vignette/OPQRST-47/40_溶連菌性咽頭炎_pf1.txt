"A 10-year-old male presented with a chief complaint of sore throat, fever, and swollen tonsils, which had persisted for 2 days. His symptoms began suddenly with a high-grade fever reaching 39.2°C, accompanied by severe throat pain that worsened with swallowing. He reported no cough, nasal congestion, or rhinorrhea. There was no associated rash, abdominal pain, vomiting, or diarrhea. He had no known drug allergies and no significant medical history. He had not received any current medications or antibiotic therapy prior to presentation.
Physical examination revealed an ill-appearing child with a fever of 38.8°C and a heart rate of 120 bpm. BP was 110/70 mmHg, and SpO2 was 98% on room air. HEENT examination showed erythematous and edematous pharyngeal walls, and the tonsils were notably enlarged with whitish exudates bilaterally. Cervical lymphadenopathy was noted, with tender, mobile lymph nodes approximately 2 cm in size. No conjunctival injection, oral ulcers, or perioral erythema were observed. The lung examination was clear to auscultation bilaterally, and no wheezes or rales were present. The cardiovascular and abdominal examinations were unremarkable. There were no rashes or signs of skin desquamation.
Laboratory findings included an elevated WBC count of 16,500/μL with 80% neutrophils. CRP was elevated at 35 mg/L. Rapid antigen detection test (RADT) for GAS was positive. Throat culture was obtained but was pending at the time of diagnosis. Mononucleosis testing was not performed as there was no suspicion of EBV.
Based on clinical findings and the positive RADT result, a diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis was made. The patient was prescribed oral amoxicillin at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day divided into two doses for a duration of 10 days. Given the patient's weight of 32 kg, the calculated dose was 800 mg twice daily. Instructions regarding adherence to the full course of treatment were emphasized, along with measures to prevent transmission.
On follow-up after 48 hours of starting antibiotics, the patient's fever had subsided, and throat pain showed significant improvement. He was able to eat and drink without difficulty. The cervical lymphadenopathy had reduced in size and tenderness. At the 10-day follow-up, he remained asymptomatic, and a complete remission of symptoms was reported."
