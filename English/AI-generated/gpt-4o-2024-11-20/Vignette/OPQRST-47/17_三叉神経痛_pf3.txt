"A 54-year-old male presented with recurrent, severe, sharp pain localized around his right periorbital region. The pain occurred in brief, paroxysmal episodes lasting seconds to a few minutes and was triggered by exposure to cold air or tactile stimuli, such as washing his face. These symptoms had begun approximately six months prior and progressively increased in frequency and intensity. The patient reported no associated visual changes, numbness, or motor deficits in the affected area. He had a history of asthma, managed with inhaled corticosteroids, and denied any history of facial trauma, recent infections, or dental procedures.
On physical examination, the patient appeared in a generally well condition but displayed discomfort when describing his pain. Neurological assessment revealed no focal deficits. Cranial nerve examination showed no evidence of weakness, sensory loss, or abnormalities in reflexes. Specific palpation and light touch over the distribution of the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve (V1) reproduced the patientâ€™s symptoms. No erythema, swelling, or skin changes were observed in the affected region. The remainder of the physical examination was unremarkable.
MRI of the brain with and without contrast was performed to exclude structural abnormalities, vascular compression, or space-occupying lesions involving the trigeminal nerve. Imaging results revealed no masses, demyelinating plaques, or vascular malformations. MRA excluded the presence of vascular compression on the nerve, particularly at the root entry zone. Laboratory evaluations, including CBC, ESR, CRP, and metabolic panels, were within normal limits.
The clinical presentation, along with the absence of secondary causes on imaging, led to a diagnosis of primary trigeminal neuralgia (TN), predominantly affecting the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve.
Initial management included pharmacological therapy with carbamazepine, administered at a starting dose of 100 mg twice daily, gradually titrated to 400 mg twice daily over two weeks, based on therapeutic response and tolerance. The patient experienced substantial reduction in pain frequency and intensity within one week of treatment initiation. Serum drug levels were monitored to ensure therapeutic efficacy without toxicity. The medication was well-tolerated, with no adverse effects such as dizziness, nausea, or hepatic dysfunction reported during the follow-up.
Following three months of therapy, the patient reported complete remission of symptoms, allowing a return to his normal daily activities. Carbamazepine therapy was continued at a maintenance dose of 400 mg daily, with periodic follow-ups to monitor for recurrence, drug tolerability, and side effects."
