"A 50-year-old female presented with acute onset of chest pain, fever, and generalized fatigue that began three days prior to admission. The chest pain was sharp, pleuritic, and radiated to the left shoulder, worsening with deep breaths and improved when sitting up and leaning forward. She denied any history of trauma, recent upper respiratory infections, weight loss, or known chronic illnesses. No prior significant medical, surgical, or family history was reported.
On physical examination, the patient was febrile with a temperature of 38.5°C, her HR was 110 bpm, and BP was 125/78 mmHg. She appeared mildly distressed due to chest pain. Cardiovascular examination revealed normal heart sounds but with a characteristic pericardial friction rub best heard at the left lower sternal border when the patient was leaning forward. Breath sounds were normal bilaterally without rales or wheezing. There was no evidence of peripheral edema, jugular venous distension, or hepatomegaly.
Initial laboratory tests showed elevated WBC count of 14,000/µL, CRP of 45 mg/L, and ESR of 72 mm/hr. Troponin levels were minimally elevated at 0.04 ng/mL but not consistent with myocardial infarction. ANA, RF, and Tb tests were negative. Echocardiography showed a small pericardial effusion without signs of tamponade. ECG revealed diffuse concave ST-segment elevations and PR-segment depressions, particularly in leads I, II, V5, and V6, consistent with acute pericarditis. CXR was normal.
The patient was diagnosed with acute pericarditis, most likely idiopathic, though a viral etiology was suspected given the absence of other systemic findings. Blood cultures, although obtained, did not reveal any pathogenic growth.
Treatment began with ibuprofen 600 mg orally every 8 hours for pain relief and reduction of inflammation. Colchicine 0.5 mg twice daily was added to reduce recurrence risks. The patient was advised to avoid strenuous physical activity during recovery. Over the next 48 hours, her symptoms significantly improved, and her fever subsided. She was discharged on ibuprofen and colchicine with instructions for outpatient follow-up. At her 2-week follow-up, she remained asymptomatic, and laboratory markers of inflammation normalized. A follow-up echocardiogram showed resolution of the pericardial effusion."
