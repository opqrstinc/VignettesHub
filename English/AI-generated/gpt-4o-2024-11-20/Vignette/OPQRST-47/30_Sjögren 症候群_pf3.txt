"A 38-year-old female presented with complaints of persistent dry eyes and dry mouth for approximately six months, accompanied by intermittent bilateral joint pain primarily involving the small joints of her hands and wrists. Additionally, she reported mild fatigue and difficulty swallowing dry food, which had progressively worsened. She denied fever, weight loss, skin rash, or photosensitivity. Significant medical or family history of autoimmune diseases was absent, and she took no regular medications. 
On physical examination, she appeared well. Ocular inspection revealed conjunctival injection and reduced tear meniscus in both eyes. Schirmer's test demonstrated markedly decreased tear production. Oral examination revealed a dry, erythematous oral mucosa without ulceration. Dental inspection showed evidence of poor saliva secretion but no overt dental caries. The joints of her hands and wrists exhibited mild tenderness without erythema, swelling, or synovitis.
Lab findings revealed positive ANA at a titer of 1:320 with a speckled pattern. Anti-SSA/Ro and anti-SSB/La Abs were strongly positive. RF was positive, though CCP Abs were negative. ESR and CRP were mildly elevated. CBC showed normal WBC, Hgb, and platelet counts. CMP revealed no significant abnormalities. Urinalysis was unremarkable. Ophthalmological testing showed dye staining on the cornea consistent with keratoconjunctivitis sicca. A minor salivary gland biopsy of the lower lip confirmed lymphocytic infiltration with a focus score >1, meeting diagnostic criteria for Sjögren syndrome.
The patient was diagnosed with primary Sjögren syndrome. Treatment was initiated with hydroxychloroquine 400 mg daily for systemic symptoms and to alleviate joint pain. Artificial tears containing carboxymethylcellulose were recommended for use as needed to manage dry eyes. Additionally, pilocarpine 5 mg orally three times daily was prescribed to stimulate salivary flow and reduce xerostomia symptoms. The patient was educated on proper hydration and dental hygiene practices to prevent dental complications associated with hyposalivation.
At follow-up after three months, she reported improvement in ocular and oral dryness and decreased joint pain. Lab markers showed stable inflammatory parameters. Hydroxychloroquine was continued at the same dose, and pilocarpine therapy was maintained. Regular monitoring was advised to assess disease stability and potential side effects, including retinal toxicity.
