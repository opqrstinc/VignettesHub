"A 6-year-old female presented with a 3-day history of fever, rhinorrhea, and an erythematous maculopapular rash that began on the face and subsequently spread to the trunk and extremities. Her mother reported that the fever started abruptly, reaching up to 39.5°C and persisted despite antipyretic administration. Over the next 24 hours, the rash appeared and became progressively widespread. She also experienced mild conjunctival injection and non-productive cough. She had no significant medical history, no known allergies, and no prior immunizations documented in her medical records, including the MMR vaccine.
On physical examination, the patient was alert but irritable. Her body temperature was measured at 38.9°C. She exhibited erythematous maculopapular lesions predominantly on the face, chest, back, and limbs. Koplik spots were identified on the oral mucosa, particularly on the buccal surfaces, appearing as tiny white lesions with erythematous halos. Mild conjunctival erythema was present, without discharge, and she had clear rhinorrhea. Cervical lymphadenopathy was noted, but no hepatosplenomegaly or other significant systemic findings were observed. Lung auscultation revealed no abnormal breath sounds. 
Laboratory investigations showed a WBC count of 6,800/µL with relative lymphocytosis, and CRP was slightly elevated. LFT was within normal limits. A measles-specific IgM serologic test returned positive, and RT-PCR detected measles RNA from a nasopharyngeal swab, confirming the diagnosis. Testing for other viral etiologies, including EBV and CMV, was negative. Chest X-ray demonstrated no pulmonary infiltrates or consolidation.
The diagnosis was measles based on the characteristic clinical presentation, positive measles-specific IgM, and PCR confirmation. 
Treatment was initiated immediately after diagnosis. Supportive care was provided, including adequate hydration and symptomatic management of fever with acetaminophen at a dose of 15 mg/kg every 6 hours as needed. Vitamin A supplementation was administered as recommended for measles treatment, with a dose of 200,000 IU orally on the day of diagnosis and a second dose 24 hours later. The patient was isolated to prevent further transmission of the virus. No indications for antiviral therapy were identified. 
During the course of treatment, the fever subsided within 48 hours, and the rash began to resolve, with a noticeable shift from erythematous maculopapular lesions to brownish discoloration over the next week. The Koplik spots disappeared within 3 days. The patient demonstrated significant clinical improvement, with no development of complications such as pneumonia or encephalitis. Follow-up evaluation 2 weeks post-diagnosis confirmed complete recovery. Her parents were counseled on the importance of future immunizations, including a catch-up MMR vaccine, to avoid recurrence or secondary infections."
