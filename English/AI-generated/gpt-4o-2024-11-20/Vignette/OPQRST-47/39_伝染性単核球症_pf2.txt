"A 22-year-old female presented with complaints of fever, fatigue, and sore throat persisting for approximately 7 days. She reported that the symptoms began gradually, with the fever being intermittent and associated with night sweats. The fatigue was described as profound, limiting her daily activities. She also reported a mild headache and a decrease in appetite but denied nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain. There was no history of recent travel, animal exposure, or sick contacts. She had no significant medical, surgical, or family history, nor was she on any medications.
On physical examination, the patient appeared fatigued but fully oriented. Vital signs revealed a temperature of 38.5°C, heart rate of 92 bpm, and blood pressure of 118/72 mmHg. Examination of the oropharynx showed erythema with bilateral tonsillar enlargement and exudates. There was marked bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy, predominantly in the anterior chain, with nodes that were tender and mobile. No hepatomegaly or splenomegaly was detected on abdominal palpation. Respiratory, cardiovascular, and neurological examinations were unremarkable.
A complete blood count revealed leukocytosis with a WBC count of 14,500/μL, significant lymphocytosis at 70%, and the presence of atypical lymphocytes on the peripheral blood smear. Platelet and Hb levels were within reference ranges. Liver function tests showed elevated ALT at 165 U/L and AST at 132 U/L. EBV serological testing was performed, revealing positive findings for IgM antibodies to viral capsid antigen and negative results for IgG antibodies to Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen, confirming acute EBV infection. A Monospot test returned positive as well. Tests for CMV IgM and HIV screening were negative. A throat swab culture was negative for Group A Streptococcus.
Based on the clinical presentation, physical examination, laboratory results, and serological findings, the patient was diagnosed with infectious mononucleosis secondary to primary EBV infection.
Supportive care was initiated, including the recommendation for adequate hydration, rest, and analgesia with acetaminophen 500 mg every 6 hours as needed for fever and throat discomfort. She was advised to avoid contact sports or activities that may increase the risk of splenic injury. No antiviral therapy was indicated, as the infection is self-limiting in immunocompetent individuals. A follow-up visit was scheduled for two weeks to assess recovery and monitor for potential complications such as splenic rupture or secondary bacterial infections.
At the follow-up, the patient reported significant improvement in her symptoms, with resolution of fever and sore throat after approximately ten days. Fatigue persisted but was gradually improving. Repeat examination did not reveal lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly. Liver enzyme levels had also normalized. The patient was counseled to continue avoiding strenuous activities for an additional two weeks and was discharged from further follow-up."
