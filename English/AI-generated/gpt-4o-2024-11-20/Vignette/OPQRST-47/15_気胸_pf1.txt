"A 25-year-old male presented to the emergency department with sudden-onset left-sided chest pain and shortness of breath that began 2 hours prior to arrival. The chest pain was sharp, pleuritic, and non-radiating, exacerbated by deep inspiration and movement. He denied fever, cough, hemoptysis, or recent trauma. He reported no significant medical history, no recent travel, and no family history of pulmonary diseases. He was a non-smoker and reported no substance use.
On physical examination, the patient appeared mildly distressed but was alert and oriented. Vital signs revealed a heart rate of 105 bpm, respiratory rate of 22/min, blood pressure of 124/76 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. On lung auscultation, breath sounds were diminished over the left upper lung field, with hyperresonance to percussion in the same area. No wheezes or crackles were noted, and the trachea was midline. The remainder of the systemic examination was unremarkable.
A chest X-ray revealed a left-sided pneumothorax with a visible visceral pleural line and absence of lung markings extending peripherally. The left lung appeared partially collapsed, and the pneumothorax was estimated to occupy approximately 25% of the hemithorax. No mediastinal shift or associated rib fractures were seen. Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis on room air showed a slight respiratory alkalosis (pH 7.47, PaCO2 34 mmHg, PaO2 85 mmHg), with no significant hypoxemia. ECG was normal, ruling out cardiac causes of the chest pain. Other laboratory tests, including CBC and CRP, were within normal limits.
The diagnosis of a primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) was established based on the clinical presentation, imaging findings, and absence of underlying lung pathology. The patient was appropriately counseled regarding his condition and treatment options.
As the pneumothorax was small to moderate in size, an initial conservative approach was attempted. The patient was placed on supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula at 4 L/min to enhance pleural air reabsorption. Follow-up chest X-rays were performed every 6 hours to monitor resolution. However, after 18 hours of observation, imaging revealed no significant reduction in pneumothorax size, and the patient continued to report mild dyspnea.
Given the persistence of symptoms and lack of improvement, needle aspiration was performed using an 18-gauge needle and a 60 mL syringe under sterile conditions. Approximately 400 mL of air was successfully aspirated, and immediate post-procedure imaging confirmed partial re-expansion of the lung. To facilitate complete resolution, a small-bore chest tube (14 Fr) connected to a one-way Heimlich valve was inserted. The patient tolerated the procedure well and reported significant symptomatic relief.
Over the next 48 hours, serial chest X-rays demonstrated near-complete resolution of the pneumothorax. The chest tube was removed without complications, and the patient remained asymptomatic. He was discharged on the third hospital day with instructions to avoid air travel and high-altitude activities for 2-4 weeks and to return for outpatient follow-up in one week. No pharmacological therapy was required. He was educated on the risk of recurrence, which was estimated to be approximately 30%, and warned to seek medical attention promptly should similar symptoms occur in the future."
