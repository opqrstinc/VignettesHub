"A 65-year-old male presented with a complaint of transient right-sided weakness, slurred speech, and blurred vision, which began approximately two hours before seeking medical attention. The symptoms resolved completely within 30 minutes without residual deficits. He reported no associated headache, nausea, vomiting, or loss of consciousness. He had a history of uncontrolled HTN for 15 years, but he was not compliant with his antihypertensive medications. There was no previous history of stroke, AF, DM, or TIA. He denied smoking, alcohol consumption, or illicit drug use. His family history was non-contributory.
On physical examination, his BP was elevated at 185/102 mmHg, and HR was 78 bpm with a regular rhythm. Respiratory rate and SpO2 were within normal limits, and he was afebrile. Neurological examination revealed no motor or sensory deficits. Speech was normal, and cranial nerve function was intact. There were no cerebellar signs or gait disturbances. Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular heart rhythm with no murmurs. No carotid bruits were audible. The remainder of the systemic exam was unremarkable.
Initial lab investigations, including CBC, CMP, fasting glucose, lipid profile, and coagulation studies, were within normal limits except for an elevated LDL cholesterol level of 145 mg/dL. Cardiac enzymes were negative. Non-contrast CT of the head showed no evidence of acute infarction, hemorrhage, or mass effect. MRI with DWI revealed no acute ischemic lesions. Carotid duplex ultrasound demonstrated a 40% stenosis in the right ICA and mild atherosclerotic changes in the left ICA. TTE showed no evidence of thrombus or structural abnormalities, and EF was preserved at 55%. ECG showed NSR without ST-T wave changes. Further evaluation with Holter monitoring did not detect any episodes of paroxysmal AF.
The patient was diagnosed with TIA likely due to HTN and underlying atherosclerosis, given his symptoms, their brief duration, and the absence of lasting neurological deficits. The ABCD2 score was calculated at 4, indicating a moderate risk of subsequent stroke.
The treatment plan included aggressive BP control and secondary stroke prevention. He was started on aspirin 81 mg daily and clopidogrel 75 mg daily for dual antiplatelet therapy. Atorvastatin 40 mg daily was initiated for lipid management. Lisinopril 10 mg daily was prescribed for BP control, along with amlodipine 5 mg daily. The patient was counseled extensively on adherence to medication, lifestyle modifications, smoking cessation, and dietary changes. He was referred for outpatient carotid duplex follow-up to monitor stenosis progression.
During follow-up visits over the subsequent three months, his BP was reduced to 130/80 mmHg, his LDL cholesterol decreased to 85 mg/dL, and no recurrent TIAs or strokes were reported. Dual antiplatelet therapy was discontinued after one month, and aspirin monotherapy was continued."
