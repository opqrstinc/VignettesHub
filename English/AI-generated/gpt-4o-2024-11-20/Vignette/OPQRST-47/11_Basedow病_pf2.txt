"A 42-year-old male presented with complaints of unintentional weight loss of approximately 7 kg over the past two months and persistent fatigue. He reported experiencing heat intolerance, excessive sweating, palpitations, and restlessness during this period. The symptoms progressively worsened, leading to difficulty concentrating at work and overall reduced quality of life. There was no recent history of infections or significant stressors. His past medical history revealed type 2 DM for which he had been taking metformin 1000 mg twice daily. He denied smoking or alcohol consumption. Family history was significant for thyroid disease in his mother.
On physical examination, the patient appeared anxious and exhibited a resting heart rate of 112 bpm with an irregular rhythm. His BP was 138/76 mmHg, and his temperature was 37.3°C. Examination of the neck revealed a diffusely enlarged, non-tender thyroid gland without discrete nodules. Exophthalmos with mild periorbital edema and lid lag were noted bilaterally. Auscultation of the heart revealed an irregularly irregular rhythm. His skin was warm and moist with fine tremors noted in both outstretched hands. Muscle strength was reduced in the proximal muscles of the upper and lower limbs. There was no evidence of pretibial myxedema or other dermatological changes.
Laboratory tests revealed elevated free T4 at 3.4 ng/dL and suppressed TSH at <0.01 μIU/mL. T3 was also elevated at 225 ng/dL. TSI was markedly positive. HbA1c was 7.1%, and random glucose levels were 178 mg/dL. Electrolyte values were within normal limits. A complete blood count showed no abnormalities. ECG demonstrated atrial fibrillation. Thyroid ultrasound revealed diffuse enlargement with increased vascularity but no nodules. A thyroid uptake scan showed significant diffuse uptake of 60%.
A diagnosis of Graves' disease (Basedow's disease) with associated thyrotoxicosis and atrial fibrillation was made. The patient was started on methimazole at an initial dose of 15 mg daily to reduce thyroid hormone synthesis. Propranolol 40 mg twice daily was initiated to manage the symptoms of tachycardia and decrease adrenergic activity. Anticoagulation with apixaban 5 mg twice daily was prescribed for stroke prevention due to atrial fibrillation. Metformin was continued for glucose control, and no insulin therapy was deemed necessary.
The patient was reviewed two weeks later, reporting a reduction in palpitations and improved energy levels, though occasional fatigue persisted. Repeat labs showed a decline in free T4 to 2.1 ng/dL and T3 to 140 ng/dL, while TSH remained suppressed. No adverse effects of methimazole were noted. Anticoagulation therapy monitoring showed no complications. At a six-week follow-up, free T4 and T3 had normalized, with TSH showing a gradual increase. A decision was made to continue methimazole and maintain the current dosage of propranolol and apixaban. Plans for long-term management, including the potential for RAI therapy, were discussed with the patient."
