"A 28-year-old female presented with a 6-month history of progressive muscle weakness, easy bruising, weight gain, and irregular menstrual periods. She reported proximal limb weakness that interfered with daily activities, such as climbing stairs or standing from a seated position. She also observed increased facial rounding and erythema, as well as purple striae over her abdomen and thighs. Her weight had increased by approximately 10 kg over the past six months without any significant changes in diet or exercise. She denied any use of exogenous glucocorticoids or other contributing medications. Her history included hypothyroidism, diagnosed at age 24, currently managed with levothyroxine (100 μg daily).
On physical examination, her BMI was 29.7 kg/m². Moon facies, supraclavicular fat pads, and central obesity were evident. Purple striae were noted on the abdomen and upper thighs, measuring approximately 2 cm in width. She had significant bruises without evidence of trauma. Examination revealed proximal muscle weakness in the upper and lower extremities, characterized by decreased muscle strength (3/5) on manual muscle testing. She exhibited no signs of hirsutism but had mild acne. Blood pressure was elevated at 152/94 mmHg.
Initial laboratory testing revealed elevated 24-hour urinary free cortisol at 480 μg (normal < 50 μg), suppressed ACTH < 5 pg/mL, and lack of cortisol suppression after low-dose dexamethasone suppression test (1 mg overnight; cortisol: 14.8 μg/dL). Serum potassium was mildly decreased at 3.3 mmol/L. Thyroid function tests were within normal limits under adequate levothyroxine therapy, and fasting glucose was elevated at 126 mg/dL. Imaging with an abdominal CT scan identified a 3.0-cm low-density lesion in the right adrenal gland, consistent with an adrenal adenoma.
The patient was diagnosed with ACTH-independent Cushing syndrome secondary to an adrenal adenoma. Surgical intervention was planned. She underwent right laparoscopic adrenalectomy without complications.
Postoperatively, she was initiated on hydrocortisone replacement therapy due to suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. An initial dose of hydrocortisone 20 mg in the morning and 10 mg in the afternoon was prescribed. She reported gradual improvement in symptoms, including muscle strength and reduction in bruising and striae appearance, over the subsequent months. Blood pressure and fasting glucose normalized, and her weight decreased by 6 kg within three months. At six months post-surgery, all clinical and biochemical markers of hypercortisolemia had resolved, and hydrocortisone was tapered under close endocrine supervision."
