"A 28-year-old female presented with complaints of a sore throat, neck pain, and swelling in the anterior region of the neck that had persisted for two weeks. She also reported fatigue, mild fever, and a feeling of warmth but denied night sweats, significant weight changes, or palpitations. She first noticed discomfort in her throat, which progressively worsened and was exacerbated by swallowing. She denied any recent upper respiratory infections, trauma, or exposure to toxic substances. She had no significant medical history, was not taking any medications, and had no known allergies.
On physical examination, she had a low-grade fever of 37.8°C, a pulse rate of 95 bpm, and a BP of 115/70 mmHg. The thyroid gland was tender to palpation and diffusely swollen, more prominently on the right side, with no palpable nodules. Cervical lymphadenopathy was absent. There were no exophthalmos, lid lag, or tremors. The rest of the systemic examination was unremarkable.
Laboratory investigations revealed elevated ESR at 62 mm/h and CRP at 45 mg/L, indicating inflammation. Thyroid function tests showed suppressed TSH <0.01 μIU/mL, elevated FT4 at 2.8 ng/dL, and elevated FT3 at 6.5 pg/mL, consistent with thyrotoxicosis. Thyroid peroxidase antibodies and thyroglobulin antibodies were negative, ruling out autoimmune thyroid diseases. A thyroid US demonstrated a diffusely hypoechoic and heterogeneous thyroid with no discrete nodules. FNAC was not performed, as clinical and US findings were sufficiently diagnostic. A radioactive iodine uptake (RAIU) scan showed reduced uptake (<2%), which confirmed the diagnosis of subacute thyroiditis.
The patient was treated with NSAIDs for inflammation and pain. Ibuprofen at a dose of 400 mg orally every 8 hours was initiated, along with adequate hydration and rest. Propranolol 20 mg orally twice daily was started to alleviate symptoms of thyrotoxicosis, including tachycardia and heat intolerance. Corticosteroid therapy was not required as her symptoms were adequately controlled with NSAIDs. She was advised to follow up in 2 weeks.
At her follow-up visit, she reported significant improvement in neck pain and fever. Her thyroid function tests demonstrated a decline in FT4 and FT3 levels (FT4 at 1.5 ng/dL, FT3 at 4.2 pg/mL), and TSH remained suppressed. At 6 weeks, her ESR had normalized, her thyroid function tests showed progression toward euthyroid levels, and her symptoms had resolved entirely. NSAIDs were tapered off and eventually discontinued. No recurrence of symptoms was noted on subsequent follow-up over the next 3 months."
