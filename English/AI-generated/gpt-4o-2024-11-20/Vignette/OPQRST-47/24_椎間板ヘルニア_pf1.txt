"A 48-year-old female presented with a chief complaint of severe lower back pain radiating to the right lower extremity associated with numbness and weakness in the same leg. She reported that the symptoms began insidiously four weeks prior following a day of heavy lifting. Since then, both the intensity of the pain and the neurological symptoms progressively worsened, substantially impairing her ability to ambulate and perform daily activities. She denied any recent trauma, fever, bowel or bladder dysfunction, or unintentional weight loss. Her medical history was significant for chronic episodic lower back pain over the past five years, though the current episode was much more severe.
On physical examination, she appeared distressed due to pain and was observed to have a mildly hunched posture while standing. Palpation revealed localized tenderness at the L3–L5 region of the lumbar spine. Lumbar spine range of motion was markedly limited due to pain. Neurological examination demonstrated decreased sensation over the lateral aspect of her right lower extremity, particularly along the L5 dermatome. A motor deficit was observed in dorsiflexion with a reduction in 4/5 muscle strength in the extensor hallucis longus of the right foot. Muscle stretch reflexes revealed diminished patellar and Achilles reflexes on the right compared to the left. The straight-leg raise test elicited exacerbation of radiating pain along the right leg at 40 degrees of elevation. Testing for upper motor neuron signs, such as Babinski’s reflex and ankle clonus, was negative.
MRI of the lumbar spine revealed a large herniated, degenerated disc at the L4-L5 level with associated nerve root compression consistent with her clinical symptoms. No evidence of spinal stenosis, infection, or malignancy was noted. Laboratory tests, including CRP, ESR, and CBC, were unremarkable, eliminating infectious or systemic inflammatory processes as underlying contributors.
The diagnosis of lumbar disc herniation at L4-L5 was established. The patient was initially managed conservatively with pharmacological therapy and physical intervention. She was prescribed oral gabapentin 300 mg three times daily to address neuropathic pain, along with ibuprofen 800 mg every eight hours as needed for analgesia and inflammation. A short 5-day course of oral prednisone at 40 mg daily was initiated to alleviate nerve root inflammation. Physical therapy was recommended, focusing on lumbar stabilization exercises and stretching.
Within two weeks of initiating the treatment regimen, the patient reported significant improvement in lower extremity numbness and pain intensity. Follow-up at four weeks showed restored lower limb muscle strength and resolution of ambulation difficulties. She reported compliance with prescribed exercises and medications. A gradual tapering of gabapentin and discontinuation of NSAIDs was implemented over subsequent weeks. While periodic low-grade back pain persisted, regular exercise and ergonomic modifications at work contributed to preventing symptom recurrence. Surgical referral was deemed unnecessary given her excellent response to conservative management."
