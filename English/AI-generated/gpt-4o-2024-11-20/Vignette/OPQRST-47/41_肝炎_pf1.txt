"A 30-year-old female presented with a 2-week history of fever, generalized fatigue, and progressive yellowish discoloration of her skin and sclera. She reported a loss of appetite, nausea, and dark-colored urine over the past week. There was no history of recent travel, medication use, illicit drug use, or alcohol consumption. She denied any prior episodes of similar symptoms and had no significant medical or surgical history.
On examination, she appeared mildly icteric. Vital signs showed a temperature of 38.2°C, HR of 92 bpm, BP of 118/74 mmHg, and oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. Abdominal examination revealed mild tenderness in the RUQ without rebound or guarding. The liver edge was palpable 2 cm below the costal margin, and there was no splenomegaly or ascites. No peripheral edema, spider angiomas, or asterixis were noted.
Laboratory investigations revealed elevated AST (358 U/L), ALT (420 U/L), ALP (180 U/L), and TB (8.6 mg/dL) with a DB of 5.4 mg/dL. PT was prolonged at an INR of 1.3. CBC showed mild leukocytosis with a WBC of 12,300/μL and no eosinophilia. Hb and PLT were within normal limits. Serologic testing was positive for HBsAg and anti-HBc IgM, confirming the diagnosis of acute hepatitis B infection. Anti-HCV, anti-HAV IgM, and anti-HEV IgM were all negative. Testing for autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson disease, and other metabolic conditions yielded no abnormalities. Abdominal US demonstrated no biliary obstruction, masses, or evidence of chronic liver disease.
The patient was diagnosed with acute hepatitis B based on her clinical presentation, serologic findings, and elevated liver enzymes consistent with hepatocellular injury. Given her moderate disease severity and lack of significant coagulation abnormalities or encephalopathy, she was managed conservatively. Supportive care included hydration and nutritional support. Antiviral therapy with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) 300 mg orally once daily was initiated due to signs of severe acute hepatitis, defined by elevated TB and impaired synthetic liver function with an INR > 1.2.
Her clinical condition gradually improved. Fever resolved by day 3 of treatment, and her appetite began to return by the end of the first week. Follow-up LFTs after two weeks showed a decline in AST (112 U/L), ALT (130 U/L), and TB (2.1 mg/dL). PT normalized with an INR of 1.1. After 1 month of therapy, her liver enzymes nearly normalized. TDF was discontinued at the 3-month follow-up visit as her HBV DNA level was undetectable, and seroconversion to anti-HBs was confirmed. She remained asymptomatic thereafter, with no further complications or recurrence."
