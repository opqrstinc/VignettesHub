"A 55-year-old female presented to the emergency department with acute-onset, severe right upper quadrant (RUQ) abdominal pain radiating to the back. The pain began approximately 3 hours prior to presentation and was described as colicky, sharp, and worsening in intensity. It was associated with nausea and multiple episodes of non-bilious, non-bloody vomiting. She reported no fever, chills, or changes in bowel or urinary habits. She stated a prior history of cholecystitis several years ago, but she did not undergo cholecystectomy at that time. There was no history of jaundice, or recent travel, and she denied alcohol use.
On physical examination, her vital signs showed a BP of 136/80 mmHg, HR of 92 bpm, RR of 18/min, and a temperature of 37.5°C. She appeared to be in moderate distress due to pain. Abdominal examination revealed tenderness in the RUQ with guarding, but no evidence of rebound tenderness. Murphy’s sign was positive. There was no palpable mass, and bowel sounds were present. Cardiopulmonary and neurological examinations were unremarkable.
Laboratory tests showed an elevated WBC count of 13,500/μL with neutrophilic predominance. Liver function tests revealed elevated AST (53 U/L), ALT (65 U/L), ALP (190 U/L), and total bilirubin (1.8 mg/dL). A serum lipase level was within the normal range. CRP was elevated at 5.6 mg/dL. Serum electrolytes, renal function, and coagulation studies were within normal limits. A transabdominal US demonstrated gallstones within a mildly thickened gallbladder wall without pericholecystic fluid. The common bile duct was normal in caliber, and no biliary sludge or stones were noted in the bile ducts. No evidence of intrahepatic bile duct dilation was observed.
Based on clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings, the diagnosis of biliary colic secondary to gallstones was established.
For symptom management, the patient received parenteral hydration with 0.9% sodium chloride at 100 mL/hr and IV ketorolac 30 mg every 6 hours as needed for pain. IV ondansetron 4 mg every 8 hours was administered for nausea. She was kept NPO and monitored for signs of cholecystitis or biliary obstruction. Following symptomatic stabilization, elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed 48 hours later. Perioperative antibiotics were given as prophylaxis with IV cefazolin 2 g administered preoperatively. The surgery was uneventful, and there were no intraoperative complications.
Postoperatively, the patient was transitioned to oral acetaminophen 650 mg every 6 hours for residual discomfort and was discharged home 2 days after the procedure with instructions to avoid fatty meals temporarily. Follow-up at 2 weeks revealed complete resolution of symptoms, with no further episodes of abdominal pain. Laboratory tests repeated at that time showed normalization of previously elevated LFTs."
