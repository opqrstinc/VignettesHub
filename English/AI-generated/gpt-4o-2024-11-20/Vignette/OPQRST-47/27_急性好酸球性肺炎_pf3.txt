"A 22-year-old male presented with a 5-day history of dry cough, progressive dyspnea, and fever. He reported that the symptoms initially started as mild cough and general fatigue, but within a few days, his respiratory symptoms worsened significantly, leading to shortness of breath even at rest. He denied chest pain, hemoptysis, night sweats, or weight loss. He had no prior history of respiratory or cardiac diseases and was previously healthy. There was no history of recent travel, exposure to sick contacts, or contact with animals. He was a non-smoker but had mentioned occasional exposure to secondhand smoke at social gatherings. He denied alcohol use or recreational drug use.
On presentation, his vital signs showed a temperature of 38.5°C, heart rate of 112 bpm, respiratory rate of 28 breaths/min, blood pressure of 128/78 mmHg, and oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 88% on room air. General examination revealed an ill-appearing young man in acute respiratory distress. Lung auscultation demonstrated diffuse fine crackles in bilateral lung fields without wheezing. No cyanosis, peripheral edema, or jugular venous distension was noted. Cardiac and abdominal examinations were unremarkable.
The initial laboratory evaluation revealed leukocytosis (WBC 17,200/μL) with prominent eosinophilia (absolute eosinophil count 3,200/μL). CRP and ESR were elevated, suggesting systemic inflammation. ABG on room air revealed hypoxemia with a PaO2 of 58 mmHg and a respiratory alkalosis. Chest X-ray showed bilateral, patchy alveolar opacities prominently distributed in the mid-to-lower lung zones. HRCT demonstrated bilateral ground-glass opacities without evidence of pleural effusion, consolidation, or lymphadenopathy. Sputum cultures, including bacterial, fungal, and AFB smears, were negative. Blood cultures were also negative. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed, showing an elevated eosinophil percentage (>30% of BAL cells). Laboratory testing for parasitic infections, including serologic tests for Strongyloides, was unremarkable. Autoimmune and hypersensitivity pneumonitis panels were negative, ruling out alternative causes.
Based on the clinical presentation, imaging findings, BAL eosinophilia, and exclusion of other potential etiologies, the patient was diagnosed with acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP).
He was started on intravenous methylprednisolone at 1 mg/kg/day for 3 days, followed by a transition to oral prednisone at 40 mg/day. Oxygen therapy was initiated via nasal cannula at 4 L/min to correct hypoxemia. His respiratory status improved rapidly within 48 hours, with relief of dyspnea and normalization of SpO2 on room air. By day 4 of hospitalization, his fever resolved, and his leukocyte count, including eosinophil count, began to normalize. Chest X-ray findings showed significant improvement in infiltrates by the end of the first week of treatment. He was discharged on day 7 with a tapering schedule of oral prednisone over 4 weeks. At his 1-month follow-up, he remained asymptomatic, and repeat imaging showed complete resolution of pulmonary opacities."
