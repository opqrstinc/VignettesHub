"A 45-year-old male presented with a chief complaint of progressive dysphagia for both solids and liquids over the past 6 months. He reported an initial difficulty swallowing solid foods, which gradually worsened to include liquids. He also described retrosternal discomfort, particularly postprandially, and occasional regurgitation of undigested food. Additionally, he experienced weight loss of approximately 5 kg over three months due to diminished oral intake. He noted occasional nighttime coughing, but denied nausea, vomiting, hematemesis, or melena. His medical history included a diagnosis of hypertension, for which he was taking amlodipine 5 mg once daily. He denied tobacco or alcohol use and reported no family history of gastrointestinal diseases.
On physical examination, the patient appeared mildly underweight but exhibited no acute distress. His vital signs were within normal limits. Cardiac and respiratory auscultation revealed no abnormalities. Abdominal examination was unremarkable, with no tenderness, organomegaly, or masses detected. Neurological examination showed no deficits, and there were no signs of peripheral lymphadenopathy or other systemic involvement.
Barium esophagography demonstrated a characteristic ""bird-beak"" narrowing at the gastroesophageal junction, with a dilated proximal esophagus and delayed passage of contrast. EGD revealed stasis of food and fluid in the esophageal lumen, along with an absence of anatomic obstruction or mucosal lesions. Biopsies taken during EGD were negative for malignancy or eosinophilic esophagitis. Esophageal manometry confirmed aperistalsis in the distal two-thirds of the esophagus and elevated LES pressure, consistent with impaired relaxation. These findings were diagnostic for achalasia. CBC, CMP, and TSH were unremarkable.
The patient underwent pneumatic dilation as the initial treatment, which was performed without complications. He was also started on nifedipine 10 mg sublingually, to be taken 20â€“30 minutes before meals as needed, to reduce LES pressure and improve dysphagia. Following the procedure and medical therapy, he reported significant improvement in swallowing function and a reduction in postprandial chest discomfort. He was advised to maintain regular follow-up for symptom monitoring and to consider additional interventions, such as Heller myotomy or POEM, if symptoms recurred or worsened. At a 3-month follow-up, he remained symptomatically improved with no new complaints."
