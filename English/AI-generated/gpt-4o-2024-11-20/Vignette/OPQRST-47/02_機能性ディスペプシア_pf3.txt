"A 33-year-old male with a history of type 2 DM presented with a 3-month history of persistent epigastric discomfort and frequent belching. He reported a sensation of fullness and bloating, especially after meals, which was not alleviated by dietary changes or antacids. The symptoms were not associated with significant weight loss, vomiting, or overt gastrointestinal bleeding. He denied any changes in bowel habits, such as diarrhea or constipation. His glycemic control, managed with metformin 1,000 mg twice daily, was reported as suboptimal.
On physical examination, his vital signs were within normal limits. BMI was 27 kg/mÂ². Abdominal examination revealed mild tenderness in the epigastrium without guarding, rebound tenderness, or palpable masses. No hepatosplenomegaly or lymphadenopathy was observed. Cardiovascular, respiratory, and neurologic examinations were unremarkable.
Laboratory tests, including CBC, CMP, and pancreatic function tests, were within normal limits. HbA1c was elevated at 7.9%. A stool test for occult blood yielded negative results. Upper GI endoscopy showed normal mucosa with no signs of gastritis, ulcers, or malignancy. Testing for H. pylori infection via urease breath test and stool antigen was negative. Abdominal US did not reveal gallstones, organomegaly, or evidence of structural abnormalities.
Based on the Rome IV criteria and exclusion of organic diseases, a diagnosis of functional dyspepsia was made. Symptoms were consistent with postprandial distress syndrome, a subtype characterized by postprandial fullness and early satiation.
Treatment was initiated with omeprazole 20 mg once daily, before breakfast, as an acid-suppressive therapy. Additionally, a prokinetic agent, metoclopramide 10 mg three times daily before meals, was prescribed to address delayed gastric emptying. The patient was also advised to modify dietary habits, including eating smaller, more frequent meals and avoiding fatty or spicy foods, which exacerbated his symptoms.
After 4 weeks of therapy, there was significant improvement in symptoms. The patient reported a reduction in epigastric discomfort and belching, allowing him to resume normal daily activities. Follow-up at 3 months confirmed sustained symptom relief. Omeprazole was continued for a total of 8 weeks, while metoclopramide was tapered and discontinued after symptomatic improvement was maintained. Long-term management plan emphasized glycemic control through optimizing DM therapy and continuing lifestyle modifications to prevent symptom recurrence."
