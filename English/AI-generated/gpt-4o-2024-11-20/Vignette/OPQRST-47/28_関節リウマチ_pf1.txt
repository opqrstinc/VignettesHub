"A 54-year-old female presented with a 6-month history of progressive joint pain, stiffness, and swelling involving both hands, wrists, and knees. She reported morning stiffness lasting approximately 2 hours each day, which improved with physical activity. The joint pain was described as symmetrical and associated with mild fatigue. She denied any history of trauma, fever, weight loss, or skin rash. There was no significant past medical history or family history of autoimmune diseases.
On physical examination, there was tenderness and swelling of the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints, as well as the wrists and knees bilaterally. Reduced range of motion was also observed in the affected joints. There was no evidence of deformities, nodules, erythema, or signs of septic arthritis. Cardiac and respiratory examinations were unremarkable, and there was no lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly.
Laboratory investigations revealed elevated inflammatory markers, with an ESR of 45 mm/h and a CRP of 12.1 mg/L. RF was positive at a titer of 120 IU/mL (reference: <14 IU/mL), and anti-CCP antibodies were strongly positive at a level of 235 U/mL. ANA testing was negative, and there were no features suggestive of systemic lupus erythematosus or other connective tissue diseases. A CBC demonstrated mild normocytic anemia with a hemoglobin level of 10.8 g/dL, but WBC and platelet counts were within normal limits. Renal and liver function tests were unremarkable. Plain radiographs of the hands showed periarticular osteopenia, soft tissue swelling, and marginal erosions at the second and third MCP joints bilaterally. There was no joint space narrowing suggestive of osteoarthritis.
The clinical presentation, along with serologic and radiologic findings, supported a diagnosis of RA. She was classified as definite RA according to the ACR/EULAR 2010 criteria.
Treatment was initiated with methotrexate (MTX) at a dose of 15 mg once weekly orally, along with folic acid at 1 mg daily to reduce MTX-related toxicity. Prednisone at a dose of 10 mg per day was prescribed as a bridging therapy to control symptoms until the MTX efficacy was achieved. Etanercept, a TNF inhibitor, was added at a dose of 50 mg weekly subcutaneously after 6 weeks due to suboptimal response to MTX monotherapy. The patient was also counseled on the importance of adherence to therapy and regular follow-up for monitoring of efficacy and potential adverse effects.
After 3 months of combination therapy, the patient reported significant improvement in joint pain and morning stiffness. Repeat physical examination demonstrated reduced swelling and tenderness in the affected joints, with no new signs of disease progression. Follow-up laboratory studies showed normalization of the CRP and ESR, and radiographs revealed no further erosive changes. The patient's functional status improved, and she was able to resume daily activities. The prednisone dose was tapered gradually and discontinued after 5 months without recurrence of symptoms. MTX and etanercept therapy were continued, and regular follow-up was scheduled every 3 months for ongoing disease management."
