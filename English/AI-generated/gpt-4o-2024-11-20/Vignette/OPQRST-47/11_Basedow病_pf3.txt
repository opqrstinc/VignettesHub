"A 28-year-old female presented with excessive sweating and irritability that had persisted for approximately two months. She reported experiencing palpitations, heat intolerance, unintentional weight loss of 5 kg despite an increased appetite, and intermittent tremors. The symptoms had gradually worsened over the last several weeks. She denied any history of recent illness, infection, or any significant medical conditions in the past. There was no family history of thyroid disease, and she was not taking any medication or supplements.
On physical examination, the patient appeared anxious and exhibited a fine tremor of the hands. Her BP was 140/80 mmHg, HR was 112 bpm, regular, and her temperature was 37.8°C. Her thyroid gland was symmetrically enlarged, soft, and diffusely tender without discrete nodules. Mild exophthalmos and lid lag were noted, but there was no periorbital edema or diplopia. Skin was warm and moist, and hair appeared thin and brittle. Reflexes were brisk, and a proximal muscle weakness was observed.
Laboratory findings revealed elevated free T4 at 3.4 ng/dL and low TSH at <0.01 μIU/mL, consistent with hyperthyroidism. TSH receptor Ab (TRAb) was markedly positive at 18 IU/L. Thyroid peroxidase Ab was also elevated. CBC and CMP were within normal limits except for mild hypercalcemia (10.8 mg/dL). A thyroid US showed diffuse thyroid enlargement with increased vascularity without nodules. A radioiodine uptake test demonstrated 65% uptake at 24 hours, significantly elevated from the normal range, supporting the diagnosis of Graves' disease.
She was diagnosed with Graves' disease based on the clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and imaging results. Treatment was initiated with methimazole at a starting dose of 30 mg daily, divided into three doses. Propranolol at 40 mg twice daily was prescribed to manage tachycardia and tremors. The patient was advised against excessive iodine intake and counseled about the importance of adherence to therapy and follow-up.
At a one-month follow-up, her symptoms had significantly improved; HR was 84 bpm, and her tremor and sweating had subsided. TSH remained suppressed, but free T4 had decreased to 1.8 ng/dL. The methimazole dose was tapered to 20 mg daily, divided into two doses, and propranolol was continued at the same dosage. At a three-month follow-up, the patient reported complete resolution of her symptoms. Free T4 levels normalized, and TRAb titer reduced. Methimazole therapy was maintained, and proper follow-up was scheduled to monitor for potential remission or the need for further adjustments."
