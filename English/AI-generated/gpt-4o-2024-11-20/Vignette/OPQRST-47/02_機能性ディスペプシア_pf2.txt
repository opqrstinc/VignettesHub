"A 28-year-old female presented with intermittent epigastric pain and reduced appetite for the past three months. She reported that the pain did not radiate and was unrelated to meals. The pain was described as a dull and non-radiating discomfort, occurring several times a week and lasting for a few hours. She denied nausea, vomiting, gastrointestinal bleeding, or significant weight loss. There was no history of recent infections, chronic diseases, alcohol consumption, smoking, or use of NSAIDs. Her past medical history was notable only for allergic rhinitis, for which she had been taking loratadine intermittently.
On physical examination, her vital signs were normal. Abdominal palpation revealed mild tenderness in the epigastrium without guarding or rebound tenderness. No palpable masses or hepatosplenomegaly were observed. Cardiovascular, respiratory, and neurological examinations were unremarkable.
Routine laboratory tests, including CBC, CRP, and electrolytes, were within normal limits. Liver function tests and pancreatic enzymes were normal, and serological testing for H. pylori IgG was negative. Upper GI endoscopy revealed no structural abnormalities such as ulcers, erosions, or malignancy. A biopsy of the gastric mucosa was performed, which showed no evidence of atrophic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, or H. pylori infection. Abdominal ultrasonography was unremarkable, ruling out biliary or pancreatic pathology. Based on Rome IV criteria, functional dyspepsia (FD) was diagnosed, as organic causes of these symptoms were excluded.
Treatment was initiated with omeprazole at a dose of 20 mg orally once daily to address a potential component of acid-related dyspepsia. Additionally, amitriptyline was prescribed at a low dose of 10 mg orally at bedtime, aimed at modulating visceral hypersensitivity. Dietary modifications were recommended, including avoiding caffeine, spicy foods, and fatty meals, alongside regular meal patterns to reduce symptom triggers.
At a follow-up appointment four weeks later, she reported significant improvement in her symptoms, including reduced frequency and intensity of epigastric pain and improved appetite. No adverse effects from the medications were noted. Treatment was continued, and she was advised to return for further evaluation if symptoms recurred or worsened."
