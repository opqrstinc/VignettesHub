"A 55-year-old male with a history of hypertension presented with the chief complaints of sudden-onset dyspnea and discomfort localized to the right side of his back. The symptoms began abruptly while he was climbing stairs earlier that day. He denied any recent trauma, fever, chest pain, or hemoptysis. He reported a 30-pack-year smoking history but had quit smoking 10 years ago. There was no prior history of respiratory symptoms or lung diseases. He also denied recent long-distance travel or immobilization.
On physical examination, he appeared in mild respiratory distress but was alert and oriented. Vital signs showed a heart rate of 102 bpm, BP of 138/86 mmHg, RR of 26/min, and SpO2 of 92% on room air. Auscultation revealed diminished breath sounds on the right side with hyperresonance on percussion over the right hemithorax. No wheezing, crackles, or signs of heart failure were present. Jugular venous distention and tracheal deviation were absent.
A CXR confirmed the clinical suspicion of a right-sided pneumothorax, demonstrating a visible visceral pleural line with the absence of lung markings in the upper and middle right lung zones. The collapsed right lung measured approximately 30%. A CT of the chest without contrast revealed no evidence of underlying lung disease, emphysema, or pulmonary nodules. No pneumomediastinum or pleural effusion was observed. Laboratory studies, including a CBC and metabolic panel, were within normal limits. ABG analysis on room air revealed mild hypoxemia with a pH of 7.43, PaCO2 of 36 mmHg, and PaO2 of 68 mmHg.
The patient was diagnosed with a spontaneous pneumothorax, classified as primary due to the absence of significant underlying lung disease. Given the size of the pneumothorax and his stable hemodynamic condition, a pigtail catheter was placed in the right pleural space for air evacuation under local anesthesia. A 14 French chest catheter was used, and it was connected to a one-way Heimlich valve. Post-procedure, CXR showed near-complete re-expansion of the right lung, and the patient reported significant symptomatic relief.
He was started on oxygen supplementation at 2 L/min via nasal cannula to improve oxygenation. Pain relief was managed with acetaminophen 650 mg every 6 hours as needed. He was monitored closely in the hospital, and serial CXR performed on days 1 and 2 showed continued lung expansion without recurrence of pneumothorax. The chest tube was clamped on day 2, and after 6 hours without evidence of recurrence on a repeat CXR, the catheter was successfully removed.
The patient was discharged on day 3 with instructions to avoid air travel or strenuous physical activity for at least 4 weeks. Smoking cessation was reinforced, and he was scheduled for follow-up in the outpatient pulmonary clinic within 1 week. He remained asymptomatic during follow-up with no evidence of recurrence."
