"A 45-year-old female presented with a 6-month history of bilateral hand pain and swelling, primarily affecting the small joints of her hands, including the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints. The pain was described as persistent, moderate in intensity, and worsened in the morning with stiffness lasting approximately 2 hours, which improved throughout the day. The symptoms progressively worsened over the past months, leading to impaired daily activities such as opening jars and typing. She denied any history of trauma, allergies, or constitutional symptoms such as fever or weight loss. She reported no similar joint complaints in the past and had no family history of autoimmune diseases.
On physical examination, the patient demonstrated marked tenderness and swelling of the MCP and PIP joints of both hands. The wrists were also mildly swollen and tender bilaterally. There was no evidence of deformities, subcutaneous nodules, or erythema. Range of motion was minimally restricted due to pain. Systemic examination was unremarkable, with no signs of organomegaly, rashes, or synovitis outside of the hands and wrists.
Laboratory investigations revealed elevated ESR at 45 mm/h and CRP at 18 mg/L. The complete blood count was within normal limits, and the renal and liver function tests were unremarkable. Serologic tests showed a positive RF at 152 IU/mL and strongly positive anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies. ANA was negative. Radiographs of the hands and wrists demonstrated periarticular osteopenia and marginal erosions in the second and third MCP joints bilaterally, as well as joint space narrowing in the wrists.
Based on the clinical presentation, serologic markers, and radiographic findings, the patient was diagnosed with RA according to the ACR/EULAR 2010 criteria.
Treatment was initiated with methotrexate (MTX) at a starting dose of 15 mg weekly, along with folic acid 1 mg daily to minimize side effects. Prednisone 10 mg daily was prescribed as a bridging therapy to manage symptom severity. After 6 weeks of methotrexate therapy, the patient reported significant improvement in pain and morning stiffness, with a reduction in joint swelling. Prednisone was gradually tapered over 8 weeks and discontinued. As the disease remained active with persistent mild joint symptoms, adalimumab, a TNF inhibitor, was initiated at a dose of 40 mg subcutaneously every other week in combination with methotrexate. Over the following 3 months, the patient achieved low disease activity, with normalization of ESR and CRP, and radiographic progression was halted."
