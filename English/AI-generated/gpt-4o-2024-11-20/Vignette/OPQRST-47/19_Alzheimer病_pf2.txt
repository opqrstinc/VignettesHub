"An 80-year-old female presented with progressive cognitive decline over a two-year period. Her primary concerns included a frequent inability to recall people's names, confusion about the day of the week, and difficulties navigating familiar places. These symptoms gradually worsened, and her family reported episodes of repetitive questioning, misplaced objects, and becoming lost even in well-known environments. She had significant trouble planning daily activities and had shown changes in behavior, including irritability and social withdrawal. Her medical history included RA managed with methotrexate and occasional corticosteroids, as well as AF for which she was being treated with apixaban. There was no family history of neurodegenerative diseases.
Physical examination revealed no focal neurological deficits. Gait was mildly unsteady, and the patient demonstrated slowed movements, but these findings were attributed to generalized musculoskeletal stiffness secondary to RA. Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scored 19/30, suggesting moderate cognitive impairment, with particular difficulties in orientation, short-term memory recall, and executive function. The neurological exam was otherwise unremarkable, without cranial nerve deficits, motor weakness, or sensory abnormalities.
MRI of the brain revealed significant hippocampal atrophy bilaterally, along with generalized cortical thinning, particularly in the temporal and parietal lobes. There was no evidence of acute infarction or space-occupying lesions. FDG-PET showed areas of hypo-metabolism in the temporoparietal regions, consistent with neurodegenerative processes. CSF analysis revealed decreased levels of amyloid-beta 42, increased total tau protein, and phosphorylated tau, consistent with AD pathology. No evidence of CNS infection or malignancy was observed. A comprehensive metabolic panel, serum B12, TSH, and syphilis serologies were within normal limits, ruling out other common etiologies of dementia.
Based on the clinical presentation, neuroimaging findings, and CSF biomarkers, a diagnosis of AD was established. No reversible causes of cognitive decline were identified, and the pattern of cortical involvement further supported this diagnosis.
She was initiated on donepezil, starting at 5 mg once daily, which was titrated to 10 mg daily after four weeks, as tolerated. Memantine at 5 mg daily was added after one month, and the dose was increased to 10 mg twice daily over the subsequent weeks. Supportive measures included detailed education for her family regarding her condition, cognitive stimulation therapy, and instructions for environmental modifications to improve safety. Her anticoagulation with apixaban was continued due to her risk factors for thromboembolic events secondary to AF.
Over the subsequent six months, family members reported some stability in her cognitive function and a mild improvement in daily task engagement. However, she continued to exhibit difficulty with complex activities and further behavioral changes, including apathy. Regular follow-ups were scheduled to monitor her progression, medication tolerance, and the need for potential adjustments in care strategies."
