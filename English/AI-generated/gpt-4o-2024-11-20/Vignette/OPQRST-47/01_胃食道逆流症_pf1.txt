"A 45-year-old male presented with complaints of postprandial heartburn and a sensation of acid regurgitation for the past six months. He described the symptoms as worsening after meals, particularly with fatty or spicy foods, and being exacerbated by lying down or bending forward. He had been using over-the-counter antacids with transient relief. These symptoms began insidiously and gradually became more frequent, occurring several times a week. He denied dysphagia, weight loss, hematemesis, or melena. His medical history was notable for hypertension, managed with amlodipine 5 mg daily. He did not smoke or consume alcohol and had no history of NSAID use.
On physical examination, his vital signs were within normal limits, with a BP of 130/80 mmHg and HR of 70 bpm. He appeared comfortable and in no acute distress. Examination of the chest, abdomen, and oropharynx did not reveal any significant abnormalities. There was no epigastric tenderness, and bowel sounds were normal.
Laboratory investigations, including a CBC, CMP, and lipase, were unremarkable. Upper GI endoscopy revealed mild erythema of the distal esophageal mucosa but no ulcerations, strictures, or Barrettâ€™s esophagus. A 24-hour pH monitoring test demonstrated an elevated esophageal acid exposure time, with an acid exposure percentage of 8.5% (normal <4%). Manometry showed normal esophageal motility but a low LES pressure of 10 mmHg (normal >15 mmHg). These findings were consistent with GERD.
The patient was diagnosed with GERD based on the clinical presentation, endoscopic findings, and confirmation with pH monitoring. Initial treatment involved lifestyle modifications, including elevating the head of the bed, avoiding meals within three hours of bedtime, reducing intake of fatty and acidic foods, and weight loss counseling, as his BMI was 28.
Pharmacologic management was initiated with omeprazole 20 mg once daily before breakfast. After four weeks of therapy, the patient reported significant improvement, with heartburn and regurgitation resolving almost completely. He was advised to continue omeprazole at the same dose for an additional eight weeks. A follow-up evaluation after three months revealed sustained symptom control.
After an eight-week course of omeprazole, he was transitioned to maintenance therapy with famotidine 20 mg every evening, as his symptoms were mild and well-controlled. He was instructed to seek medical attention if symptoms recurred or worsened."
