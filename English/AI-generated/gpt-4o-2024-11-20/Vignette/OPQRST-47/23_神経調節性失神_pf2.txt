"A 22-year-old female presented with complaints of dizziness, fatigue, and episodic syncope lasting for the past two weeks. She reported that episodes of transient loss of consciousness occurred primarily in situations such as prolonged standing or in warm environments, with preceding symptoms including lightheadedness, nausea, blurred vision, and a sensation of warmth. Each episode lasted for a few seconds to minutes, and recovery was spontaneous without confusion or postictal symptoms. She reported no associated chest pain, palpitations, or dyspnea. Her medical history was significant for anemia, but she denied recent worsening of this condition. She was not on any medications and had no family history of sudden cardiac death or arrhythmias.
On physical examination, her vital signs were notable for a supine BP of 112/74 mmHg and a HR of 68 bpm. Upon standing, BP dropped to 96/65 mmHg with an associated increase in HR to 78 bpm, without reaching the threshold for diagnosing orthostatic hypotension. Cardiac auscultation revealed normal heart sounds without murmurs, gallops, or rubs. Pulmonary and abdominal examinations were unremarkable. Neurological evaluation including cranial nerve function, motor strength, and deep tendon reflexes was intact. Her skin appeared pale but without signs of dehydration.
Laboratory tests showed Hb at 11.2 g/dL, consistent with a previous diagnosis of anemia. Serum electrolytes, including Na, K, and Ca, were within normal limits. Renal and liver function tests were unremarkable. Thyroid profile, including TSH, was normal. ECG demonstrated normal sinus rhythm without QT prolongation, significant arrhythmias, or evidence of ischemia. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed normal cardiac function and no structural abnormalities. A tilt table test was performed, reproducing her symptoms of dizziness and syncope approximately 10 minutes after head-up tilt, accompanied by a drop in BP and bradycardia without significant arrhythmias, confirming the diagnosis of neurocardiogenic syncope (NCS).
The patient was diagnosed with NCS based on the typical clinical presentation, exclusion of structural heart disease, and positive response to the tilt table test. She was counseled regarding non-pharmacological measures, including adequate hydration, salt supplementation, avoidance of triggers, and physical counterpressure maneuvers during prodromal symptoms. She was also started on midodrine at a dose of 5 mg orally three times daily to improve vascular tone. In addition, fludrocortisone was prescribed at 0.1 mg orally once daily to enhance intravascular volume. Both medications were well-tolerated, with no adverse effects.
Over the course of six weeks, the patient reported a reduction in the frequency and severity of symptoms, with no further episodes of syncope. Follow-up evaluation, including BP monitoring and compliance with lifestyle modifications, demonstrated sustained improvement in her symptoms."
