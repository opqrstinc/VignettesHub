"A 58-year-old male presented with a 6-month history of progressive joint pain and swelling, primarily involving his metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints, proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints, and wrists bilaterally. He reported early morning stiffness lasting more than an hour, which improved as the day progressed. Fatigue had also been a significant concern, interfering with his daily activities. He denied recent infections, fever, weight loss, or significant trauma. There was no personal or family history of autoimmune diseases.
Physical examination revealed symmetrical synovitis and swelling in the aforementioned joints, with MCP and PIP joints being most prominently affected. Tenderness was noted on palpation, and a decreased range of motion was evident in the wrists. No deformities were present at this stage. Skin and nail inspections were unremarkable, and no subcutaneous nodules were palpated. There was no evidence of uveitis or other systemic findings concerning for connective tissue diseases.
Laboratory tests showed elevated ESR (78 mm/hr) and CRP (22 mg/L). RF was positive at 234 IU/mL, and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies were measured at a high titer (>340 units). ANA testing was negative. CBC demonstrated normocytic anemia with hemoglobin of 10.8 g/dL but was otherwise within normal limits. Renal and liver function tests were unremarkable, and uric acid levels were normal. Radiographs of the hands and wrists revealed periarticular osteopenia and marginal erosions, particularly in the MCP joints, but no evidence of advanced joint destruction.
The patient was diagnosed with RA based on the 2010 ACR/EULAR criteria, considering the characteristic clinical manifestations, serologic findings, and imaging results.
Treatment was initiated with methotrexate (MTX) at a starting dose of 15 mg weekly, administered orally, alongside folic acid 1 mg daily to mitigate potential side effects. Prednisone 10 mg daily was prescribed as a bridging therapy to provide symptomatic relief during the initial weeks of DMARD therapy. The patient was educated about the importance of routine monitoring for potential hepatotoxicity, hematologic abnormalities, and other adverse effects of MTX. NSAIDs (naproxen 500 mg twice daily) were also used for additional symptomatic relief during the acute phase.
At the 3-month follow-up, the patient reported significant improvement in joint pain, swelling, and functional status. Morning stiffness had decreased to less than 15 minutes. CRP and ESR levels had normalized, and no new joint erosions were noted on follow-up imaging. The prednisone dose was gradually tapered and discontinued by the 12-week mark, while MTX was escalated to 20 mg weekly to maintain disease control. The patient tolerated the medication well, with no evidence of adverse effects."
