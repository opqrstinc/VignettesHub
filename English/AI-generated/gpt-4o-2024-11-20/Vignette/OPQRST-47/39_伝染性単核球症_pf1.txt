"A 20-year-old male presented with a 5-day history of fever, sore throat, and generalized fatigue. These symptoms were accompanied by progressively worsening swelling in the neck and difficulty swallowing. He denied recent travel, animal contact, or sick exposures. His medical history was unremarkable, and he reported no history of allergies, medication use, or chronic illnesses. He was a non-smoker and reported occasional alcohol consumption. 
On physical examination, his temperature was 38.9°C, heart rate was 98 beats per minute, blood pressure was 122/78 mmHg, respiratory rate was 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation was 98% on room air. He appeared fatigued but was alert and oriented. Bilateral, non-tender cervical lymphadenopathy was palpable, with lymph nodes measuring approximately 2-3 cm in size. Examination of the oropharynx revealed marked tonsillar hypertrophy with exudates and erythema. Splenomegaly was noted on abdominal palpation, but there was no hepatomegaly or tenderness. Skin examination revealed no rash, and there was no evidence of jaundice.
Laboratory investigations demonstrated lymphocytosis with a WBC count of 12,800/μL, 60% of which were lymphocytes. Atypical lymphocytes accounted for 20% of the total lymphocytes. Liver enzymes were mildly elevated, with ALT at 72 U/L and AST at 65 U/L. Serum bilirubin levels were normal. A Monospot test for heterophile antibodies returned positive. EBV-specific serological testing revealed elevated IgM antibodies to the viral capsid antigen (VCA) and the absence of IgG antibodies to the EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA), confirming acute infection. Rapid tests for group A streptococcus and tests for CMV and HIV were negative. A chest X-ray showed no abnormalities.
The clinical presentation, along with laboratory findings, confirmed a diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis secondary to acute EBV infection.
Supportive care was initiated. The patient was advised to maintain adequate hydration and rest. Acetaminophen at 650 mg orally every 6 hours as needed was prescribed for fever and throat pain. Given the presence of significant tonsillar hypertrophy raising concerns for potential airway obstruction, dexamethasone at 10 mg IV once was administered, followed by a tapering course of oral dexamethasone at 4 mg twice daily for 3 days. Antibiotics were not prescribed given the absence of evidence for superimposed bacterial infection.
The patient reported gradual improvement in symptoms over the subsequent 2 weeks. By his 3-week follow-up, the fever had resolved, and the sore throat had significantly diminished. Lymphadenopathy and tonsillar hypertrophy had reduced substantially. He was counseled to avoid contact sports for 4 weeks due to the risk of splenic rupture. Repeat lab evaluation at follow-up showed normalization of liver enzymes and a decrease in WBC count. No complications were observed during the recovery period."
