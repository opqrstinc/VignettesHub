"A 60-year-old male presented with a primary complaint of persistent cough and hemoptysis, which had been ongoing for three months. He reported a gradual onset of symptoms, including cough with occasional blood-tinged sputum, unintentional weight loss of approximately 10 kilograms over the past two months, and fatigue. No associated chest pain, dyspnea, or fever was noted. He had no prior medical conditions, no history of smoking, and no family history of malignancy.
On physical examination, his vital signs were within normal limits, and oxygen saturation was 97% on room air. Auscultation of the chest revealed diminished breath sounds in the right upper lung field without adventitious sounds. No cervical lymphadenopathy or clubbing of the digits was observed.
A chest X-ray revealed a right upper lobe mass and mild mediastinal widening. Further evaluation with contrast-enhanced CT of the chest confirmed a 4.5 cm irregularly shaped mass in the right upper lobe with spiculated margins and enlargement of mediastinal lymph nodes. Bronchoscopy showed an obstructive lesion in the right main bronchus, and biopsy samples were obtained. Histopathology revealed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Molecular analysis identified EGFR exon 19 deletion, while ALK rearrangement and ROS1 mutations were negative. PET-CT showed hypermetabolic activity at the primary lung lesion, mediastinal lymph nodes, and no evidence of distant metastases. Laboratory tests, including CBC and CMP, were unremarkable except for a marginal elevation in LDH. Tumor markers, such as CEA, were elevated at 35 ng/mL.
The patient was diagnosed with Stage IIIA lung adenocarcinoma. Multimodal treatment was initiated. He received neoadjuvant chemotherapy with two cycles of cisplatin at 75 mg/m² on Day 1 combined with pemetrexed at 500 mg/m² on Day 1, repeated every three weeks. The regimen was well-tolerated without grade 3 or 4 adverse events. Interval imaging after chemotherapy demonstrated a partial response with a reduction in the tumor's size and lymphadenopathy.
The patient subsequently underwent right upper lobectomy with mediastinal lymph node dissection. The postoperative course was uneventful. Adjuvant therapy was initiated with osimertinib at 80 mg daily due to the detected EGFR mutation. Follow-up imaging and clinical evaluations over the next six months showed no evidence of disease recurrence. Weight improved, and the patient reported a significant reduction in fatigue and resolution of hemoptysis."
