"A 52-year-old male presented with a two-year history of worsening xerostomia, fatigue, and migratory arthralgia affecting the knees, elbows, and small joints of the hands. He reported difficulty swallowing dry foods and required frequent sips of water. He also experienced intermittent dry eyes and blurred vision, which began six months earlier. He denied a history of fever, weight loss, or recent infections. There was no prior history of autoimmune diseases, and his family history was unremarkable.
On physical examination, he exhibited dry and atrophic oral mucosa with fissuring of the tongue. His salivary glands were mildly enlarged but non-tender. Schirmer's test yielded a significantly reduced tear production bilaterally. Joint examination revealed mild swelling and tenderness in the metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints without erythema or deformity. There was no evidence of rash, lymphadenopathy, or organomegaly.
Lab investigations revealed positive ANA at a titer of 1:320 with a speckled pattern. RF was positive at 75 IU/mL. Anti-SSA/Ro and anti-SSB/La antibodies were strongly positive, while anti-dsDNA and anti-Sm antibodies were negative. ESR was elevated at 45 mm/hr, and CRP was slightly elevated at 10 mg/L. CBC showed mild anemia with Hb of 10.8 g/dL and normal WBC and platelet levels. Comprehensive metabolic panel and kidney function tests were within reference ranges. Urinalysis was unremarkable, with no evidence of proteinuria or hematuria. A minor salivary gland biopsy demonstrated focal lymphocytic sialadenitis with a focus score of 3.0. Ocular staining confirmed keratoconjunctivitis sicca.
The patient was diagnosed with primary Sj√∂gren syndrome based on the presence of xerostomia, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, positive anti-SSA/Ro and anti-SSB/La antibodies, and lymphocytic infiltration in the salivary gland biopsy. Secondary causes such as SLE or RA were excluded based on the clinical presentation and negative serologies.
He was initiated on hydroxychloroquine at a dosage of 200 mg once daily to address arthralgia and systemic inflammation. Artificial tears were prescribed for ocular symptoms, along with pilocarpine 5 mg orally three times daily to improve salivary flow. He was advised on regular dental follow-up to prevent caries and oral infections. Fatigue was managed with lifestyle modifications, including pacing of activities and improving sleep hygiene. Follow-up at six months revealed significant improvement in xerostomia and joint symptoms, with ESR reduced to 15 mm/hr and stabilized ANA titers. No adverse effects related to medications were reported."
