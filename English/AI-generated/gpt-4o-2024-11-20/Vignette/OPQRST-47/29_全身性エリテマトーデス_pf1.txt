"A 28-year-old female presented with a 4-week history of increasing fatigue, diffuse joint pain, and a distinct malar rash on her face, which she noted worsened with sun exposure. She also reported episodes of low-grade fever, intermittent hair loss, and dry eyes. There was no significant personal or family medical history of autoimmune or other chronic diseases.
On physical examination, a well-demarcated, erythematous rash was observed across the malar region, sparing the nasolabial folds. There were mild bilateral swelling and tenderness of the proximal interphalangeal joints and metacarpophalangeal joints, as well as tenderness in both knees without effusion. The patient had diffuse thinning of her hair and reported stiffness in the morning lasting approximately one hour. No mucosal ulcers or lymphadenopathy were noted. Cardiopulmonary and abdominal examinations were unremarkable.
Laboratory investigations revealed anemia (Hb 10.2 g/dL), leukopenia (WBC 2,800/μL), and thrombocytopenia (platelet count 110,000/μL). ESR was elevated at 58 mm/h, and CRP was mildly elevated at 1.2 mg/dL. Renal function tests showed normal serum creatinine levels (0.8 mg/dL) with preserved eGFR, but a urinalysis revealed proteinuria (1.2 g/day) and microscopic hematuria without casts. An ANA test returned positive at a titer of 1:640 with a speckled pattern, and a dsDNA antibody test was strongly positive (120 IU/mL). Complement levels (C3, C4) were decreased at 65 mg/dL and 8 mg/dL, respectively. Lupus anticoagulant was absent, and antiphospholipid antibody tests (anticardiolipin and beta-2 glycoprotein-I) were negative. Imaging of the joints did not demonstrate erosions, and an echocardiogram showed no evidence of pericarditis or valvular abnormalities.
Based on clinical findings and laboratory results, a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) fulfilling the ACR/EULAR 2019 criteria was made. The presence of arthritis, malar rash, hematologic abnormalities, proteinuria, positive anti-dsDNA antibodies, and low complement levels supported the diagnosis.
Treatment was initiated with hydroxychloroquine 400 mg/day and prednisone at 0.5 mg/kg/day (25 mg/day for this patient’s weight). To address the proteinuria and potential renal involvement, mycophenolate mofetil was started at a dose of 1,000 mg twice daily. Calcium (1,200 mg/day) and vitamin D3 (2,000 IU/day) supplementation were provided to mitigate corticosteroid-induced bone loss. After 4 weeks, prednisone was gradually tapered to 10 mg/day while monitoring clinical improvement and laboratory markers. The patient's symptoms, including rash and arthralgia, improved within the first month of treatment. Proteinuria decreased to 0.3 g/day, and normalization of complement levels was observed after 3 months. Hydroxychloroquine and mycophenolate mofetil were continued as maintenance therapy to prevent disease flares. Routine ophthalmologic exams were scheduled to monitor for hydroxychloroquine-induced retinal toxicity."
