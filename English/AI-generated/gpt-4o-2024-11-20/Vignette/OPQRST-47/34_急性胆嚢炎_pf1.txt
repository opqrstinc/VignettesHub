"A 74-year-old female with a history of gallstone disease presented with right upper quadrant (RUQ) abdominal pain, fever, and nausea for 2 days. The pain was described as constant, progressively worsening, and radiating to the right shoulder. She reported decreased appetite and a single episode of vomiting but denied diarrhea, chest pain, or shortness of breath. There was no history of jaundice or prior surgical interventions related to her gallbladder.
On physical examination, she was febrile with a temperature of 38.5°C and hemodynamically stable. Abdominal examination revealed tenderness in the RUQ with guarding and a positive Murphy's sign. There were no signs of peritonitis, and the remainder of the physical exam was unremarkable.
Laboratory investigations showed leukocytosis with a WBC count of 15,000/μL, elevated CRP at 12.5 mg/dL, and mild hyperbilirubinemia with a total bilirubin of 1.8 mg/dL. ALT and AST were slightly elevated at 75 U/L and 82 U/L, respectively, while ALP and GGT were also elevated. Amylase and lipase levels were within normal limits. Blood cultures were obtained but were pending at the time. Imaging with RUQ ultrasound revealed a thickened gallbladder wall measuring 5 mm, pericholecystic fluid, and gallstones, consistent with acute cholecystitis. The common bile duct was normal in diameter, with no evidence of biliary dilation or choledocholithiasis.
The diagnosis of acute calculous cholecystitis was established. The patient was admitted to the hospital and treated with IV hydration and broad-spectrum antibiotics. She was initiated on piperacillin-tazobactam at 4.5 g every 6 hours. Pain management with IV acetaminophen was provided as needed. Surgical consultation was obtained, and laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed within 48 hours of admission.
Postoperatively, the patient recovered without complications. Pathological examination of the gallbladder confirmed acute inflammation without evidence of gangrene or perforation. Antibiotics were continued for a total of 5 days, transitioning to oral amoxicillin-clavulanate (875 mg/125 mg) twice daily on discharge. She was discharged in stable condition with follow-up instructions to monitor for any signs of infection or complications."
