"A 45-year-old female presented with a 6-month history of progressive dry mouth and dry eyes, accompanied by intermittent bilateral knee pain and stiffness predominantly in the morning. She reported frequent dental caries, difficulty swallowing dry food, and the need to use artificial tears several times daily. She denied fever, weight loss, rash, or prior similar symptoms. There was no history of autoimmune diseases or other significant medical conditions. She had no family history of autoimmune disorders and was not taking any medications.
On physical examination, her vital signs were stable. The oral mucosa was notably dry, with no signs of ulceration. Dental cavities were observed. Schirmer’s test showed markedly decreased tear production bilaterally. Joint examination revealed mild swelling and tenderness in both knees without erythema or warmth. No other significant abnormalities were noted on systemic examination, including the skin, lungs, heart, and abdomen.
Laboratory investigations revealed positive ANA (1:160, speckled pattern), elevated anti-SSA/Ro antibodies, and borderline positive anti-SSB/La antibodies. RF was mildly elevated, while anti-CCP antibodies were negative. ESR and CRP were mildly elevated. CBC was notable for mild normocytic anemia, with normal WBC and platelet counts. LFTs and renal function tests were within normal limits. Urinalysis showed no abnormalities. A salivary gland biopsy from the lower lip revealed focal lymphocytic sialadenitis with a focus score of 2.0. Salivary flow testing demonstrated significantly reduced secretion. Chest imaging showed no signs of interstitial lung disease. Ophthalmologic evaluation confirmed keratoconjunctivitis sicca with decreased tear breakup time.
A diagnosis of primary Sjögren syndrome was made based on the clinical presentation, serological markers, and histopathological findings. Treatment was initiated with hydroxychloroquine at a dose of 200 mg twice daily for joint symptoms and disease modulation. She was also prescribed artificial tears for ocular dryness and pilocarpine 5 mg thrice daily to stimulate salivary secretion. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) were recommended as needed for joint pain.
During follow-up at 3 months, the patient reported significant improvement in joint pain and stiffness. Ocular and oral dryness symptoms were better managed, although not completely resolved. She tolerated the medications well without significant side effects. Regular monitoring of disease activity and symptom progression was planned, with continued use of hydroxychloroquine and symptomatic management as required."
