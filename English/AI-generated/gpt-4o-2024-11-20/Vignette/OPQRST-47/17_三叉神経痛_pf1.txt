"A 41-year-old male presented with right-sided facial pain that had been occurring intermittently for the past 3 months. The pain was described as severe, sharp, and electric shock-like in nature. It was localized to the right maxillary and mandibular regions and was triggered predominantly by actions such as chewing, speaking, or touching the right side of his face. Each episode lasted for seconds to minutes and occurred multiple times daily. He reported no preceding facial trauma, fever, or other systemic symptoms. His medical history was unremarkable, and he denied any history of chronic illnesses, surgeries, or use of long-term medications.
On physical examination, vital signs were within normal limits. Neurological examination revealed no motor weakness or sensory deficit in the cranial nerve distribution. However, light touch to the right cheek and jaw elicited paroxysms of intense pain consistent with his described episodic symptoms. There were no signs of facial asymmetry, swelling, rash, or other dermatological abnormalities on inspection. Corneal reflexes were intact bilaterally, and no limitations in jaw movement or other abnormalities were observed.
MRI of the brain with and without contrast was performed to rule out secondary causes such as mass lesions, demyelinating diseases, or vascular anomalies. The imaging revealed a vascular loop of the superior cerebellar artery in close proximity to the trigeminal nerve root on the right side, suggestive of neurovascular compression. No other structural abnormalities were identified. A routine CBC, CMP, and inflammatory markers were within normal ranges. An RPR test for syphilis and serology for Lyme disease were negative.
Based on the clinical presentation and MRI findings, the patient was diagnosed with classic trigeminal neuralgia. The neurovascular conflict noted on imaging supported this diagnosis, and no alternative underlying pathology was identified.
The patient was initiated on carbamazepine at a starting dose of 100 mg twice daily. The dosage was gradually titrated to 200 mg three times daily over a two-week period based on symptom relief and tolerance. He experienced significant improvement in the frequency and intensity of pain episodes within the first week of treatment. Mild drowsiness was reported as a side effect but resolved spontaneously without discontinuation of the medication. The patient was monitored closely with serial labs, including liver function tests and CBC, which remained within normal limits during follow-up. Given the favorable response to pharmacotherapy, further interventional procedures were not pursued at this stage. As of the latest follow-up at three months, the patient maintained sustained symptom control on carbamazepine 200 mg three times daily without notable adverse effects."
