"A 22-year-old male presented with a chief complaint of persistent lack of motivation to work and insomnia for the past 3 months. He reported that his symptoms began gradually after completing university and starting a new job. He described feeling a significant loss of interest in activities he previously enjoyed, persistent fatigue, difficulty concentrating, and a sense of worthlessness. He denied recent traumatic events but mentioned a constant feeling of pressure related to his new job responsibilities. He had no prior psychiatric or medical history and denied substance or alcohol use. There was no family history of psychiatric disorders.
On physical examination, no significant abnormalities were noted. His vital signs were within normal limits, and neurological examination was unremarkable. No signs of systemic illnesses were observed. He appeared slightly disheveled and exhibited psychomotor slowing, maintaining minimal eye contact during the interview.
Laboratory tests, including CBC, CMP, thyroid function tests, and urine drug screen, were conducted to rule out secondary causes. All results were within normal limits. Additionally, no abnormalities were detected on ECG. PHQ-9 was administered, and the score was 18, indicating moderately severe depression. GAD-7 yielded a score of 5, reflecting mild anxiety. Based on clinical presentation and diagnostic criteria outlined in DSM-5, major depressive disorder (MDD) was diagnosed.
Treatment commenced with sertraline at a starting dose of 50 mg once daily. The importance of adherence to medication was emphasized, and side effects such as GI upset and headache were discussed. The patient was also referred to psychotherapy and began weekly sessions of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Sleep hygiene education was provided to address insomnia. After 4 weeks, the patient reported partial improvement in mood and energy levels, though insomnia persisted. The sertraline dose was increased to 100 mg once daily. By the 8-week follow-up, he reported significant improvement in motivation, concentration, and sleep patterns. His PHQ-9 score improved to 6, indicating mild depression. Regular follow-up was arranged to monitor response and potential side effects."
