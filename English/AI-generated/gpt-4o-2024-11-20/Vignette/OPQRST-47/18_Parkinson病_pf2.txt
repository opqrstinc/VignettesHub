"A 62-year-old female patient presented with a primary complaint of difficulty initiating movements in her legs and generalized muscle stiffness, which had progressively worsened over the past two years. She described an insidious onset of symptoms, initially noting mild stiffness predominantly in her lower extremities, which later extended to her upper extremities and neck. Over time, she reported increasing difficulty in performing daily activities, such as walking and dressing. Tremors, initially unilateral in her right hand, had become more noticeable, especially during rest. She reported no history of trauma or previous neurological disorders. Her medical history included type 2 DM managed with oral hypoglycemic agents. There was no significant family history of neurodegenerative diseases.
Physical examination revealed bradykinesia, particularly in fine motor movements, and rigidity across her extremities, most pronounced on the right side. Resting tremor was observed in her right upper limb, with a frequency of 4â€“6 Hz, ceasing during voluntary movement. Postural instability was noted during tandem gait testing, although deep tendon reflexes and muscle strength were preserved. The patient demonstrated a masked facial expression and a reduced arm swing while walking. There were no signs of cerebellar dysfunction, cranial nerve abnormalities, or sensory deficits.
Serum laboratory tests, including CBC, CMP, and thyroid function tests, were unremarkable. FBS and HbA1c were consistent with her known DM. Brain MRI showed no evidence of structural abnormalities, ischemic lesions, or tumors. A DaT-SPECT scan revealed asymmetric reduced dopaminergic tracer uptake in the striatum, more pronounced on the left side, consistent with Parkinson's disease (PD).
Based on the clinical presentation, physical examination findings, and imaging results, the diagnosis of idiopathic PD was made. The patient was initiated on carbidopa/levodopa at a dose of 25/100 mg, administered three times daily. This regimen was aimed at alleviating her motor symptoms, particularly stiffness and bradykinesia. Due to her difficulties with tremor and postural instability, trihexyphenidyl 2 mg twice daily was also prescribed. Regular monitoring was planned to assess medication efficacy and potential side effects.
During the initial three-month follow-up, the patient reported significant improvement in her ability to perform daily tasks. Rigidity and bradykinesia were substantially reduced, and her tremor was less prominent during rest. However, she experienced mild nausea, which was managed by instructing her to take carbidopa/levodopa with meals. At her six-month follow-up, the dosage of carbidopa/levodopa was titrated to 25/100 mg four times daily due to the reemergence of motor symptoms before the next dose. The patient continued trihexyphenidyl without complications, and her overall functional status improved further with physical therapy focusing on balance and muscle strength. She was advised on long-term management strategies, including regular neurologic follow-up and adjustments to therapy in response to symptom progression."
