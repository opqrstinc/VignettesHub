"A 50-year-old male presented with a primary complaint of widespread musculoskeletal pain persisting for over 6 months. He reported chronic fatigue, unrefreshing sleep, and difficulty concentrating, often referred to as ""fibro fog."" He stated that his symptoms developed insidiously, initially as intermittent myalgias, which progressively became constant and more severe, eventually interfering with his daily activities and occupational performance. The pain was described as diffuse, deep, and aching, exacerbated by stress and prolonged physical exertion. He also experienced non-restorative sleep despite adequate sleep duration, leading to persistent exhaustion. He had a history of anxiety disorder and noted increased anxiety correlating with the worsening of his symptoms. 
On physical examination, widespread tenderness was found upon palpation of soft tissues, particularly over the previously identified tender points, such as the bilateral trapezius, supraspinatus, and lateral epicondyles. No joint swelling, deformities, or erythema were observed. Neurological exam results were normal, with no focal deficits, muscle weakness, or sensory loss.
Laboratory tests, including CBC, CRP, and TSH, were unremarkable, excluding inflammatory, infectious, or endocrine etiologies of his symptoms. RF and anti-CCP were negative, and ANA testing was non-reactive, ruling out autoimmune rheumatic diseases. ESR was within normal limits. Imaging studies, including plain radiographs of the spine and joints, did not reveal any abnormalities. Polysomnography ruled out sleep apnea but confirmed disrupted sleep architecture with reduced deep and REM sleep phases. A psychiatric evaluation supported mild generalized anxiety disorder but did not account for the full extent of his symptoms. Based on the clinical history, physical exam findings, fulfillment of the ACR's diagnostic criteria, and exclusion of other conditions, a diagnosis of fibromyalgia was made.
The patient was started on duloxetine 30 mg orally once daily, titrated to 60 mg daily over 2 weeks for analgesia and symptomatic relief of fatigue and mood disturbances. Pregabalin was initiated at 75 mg orally once daily and increased to 150 mg daily, which was well-tolerated and effective in reducing pain severity. Non-pharmacologic interventions included referral to a physical therapist for a graded exercise program to enhance functional capacity and decrease deconditioning. He received cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) focusing on stress management and coping strategies, aiming to address his anxiety and improve sleep hygiene. Furthermore, education regarding the chronic nature of FM and the importance of maintaining physical activity and consistent follow-ups was provided.
During follow-up visits over 3 months, he reported marked improvements in pain intensity, fatigue, and overall quality of life. Sleep disturbances and cognitive symptoms gradually subsided. He adhered to the pharmacologic regimen without notable adverse effects. Multidisciplinary management, combining pharmacotherapy and lifestyle modifications, proved effective in achieving symptomatic control and functional recovery."
