"A 48-year-old female presented with a 4-day history of worsening chest pain, dry cough, and fever. The chest pain was described as sharp, pleuritic, and located retrosternally, radiating to the left shoulder and increasing in intensity while lying supine or during deep inspiration. The patient reported partial relief when sitting up or leaning forward. She denied recent trauma, prolonged immobilization, or family history of cardiovascular disease. Her past medical history was unremarkable, with no chronic illnesses, prior surgeries, or significant medication use. There was no history of travel, recent infections, or autoimmune conditions.
On physical examination, the patient was alert but appeared uncomfortable. Vital signs revealed a temperature of 38.4°C, heart rate 105 bpm, BP 118/74 mmHg, and respiratory rate 18 breaths/min. Peripheral oxygen saturation was 98% on room air. Cardiac auscultation revealed a high-pitched scratching sound consistent with a pericardial friction rub. Lung sounds were clear bilaterally, and no jugular venous distention or peripheral edema was observed. She had no rash, joint swelling, or other systemic signs of disease.
ECG demonstrated widespread ST-segment elevation in nearly all leads with PR depression, while reciprocal changes were noted in aVR. CXR was unremarkable, with no evidence of cardiomegaly or pulmonary consolidation. TTE revealed a small pericardial effusion with no signs of tamponade or impaired cardiac function. Blood tests showed elevated WBC count of 12,800/μL, CRP of 86 mg/L, and ESR of 48 mm/h. Troponin I levels were mildly elevated (0.34 ng/mL), reflecting pericardial inflammation without ischemic myocardial injury. ANA and RF were negative, and blood cultures showed no growth. Thyroid function tests, coagulation profile, and HIV screen were all within normal limits.
The clinical presentation, along with the characteristic ECG and imaging findings, led to a diagnosis of acute pericarditis. The suspected etiology was idiopathic, likely viral in origin, given the lack of alternative causes.
The patient was treated with ibuprofen 800 mg orally every 8 hours and colchicine 0.5 mg orally twice daily for a planned duration of 3 months. She was advised to avoid strenuous physical activity until symptoms completely resolved, and routine follow-up was scheduled. She demonstrated significant improvement within 48 hours, with a reduction in chest pain and fever. By the time of her 3-week follow-up, she reported complete resolution of symptoms. A repeat ECG showed normalization of the ST-segment elevations, and inflammatory markers also returned to normal. No recurrent symptoms were reported during the subsequent months of medical therapy."
