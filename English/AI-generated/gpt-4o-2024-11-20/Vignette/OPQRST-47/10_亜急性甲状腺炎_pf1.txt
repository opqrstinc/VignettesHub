"A 45-year-old male presented with a 2-week history of anterior neck pain and a low-grade fever. The symptoms initially began as mild discomfort in the neck, which gradually worsened over time. He also reported generalized fatigue, palpitations, and unintentional weight loss of 3 kg during the same period. His medical history was significant for hypertension, managed with amlodipine 5 mg once daily. He denied recent viral infections, trauma, or sick contacts, and his family history was unremarkable for thyroid disease. He was not taking any other medications or supplements.
On physical examination, he appeared mildly diaphoretic but was otherwise in no acute distress. His blood pressure was 138/88 mmHg, heart rate was 92 bpm, and his temperature was 38.2°C. The thyroid gland was tender on palpation, especially in the right lobe, without significant enlargement or nodularity. There was no cervical lymphadenopathy. Cardiovascular and respiratory examinations were unremarkable. No tremors, skin changes, or proximal muscle weakness were noted.
Laboratory investigations revealed elevated ESR of 70 mm/h and CRP at 48 mg/L. TFTs showed suppressed TSH <0.01 μIU/mL, elevated free T4 at 3.2 ng/dL, and increased free T3 at 8.0 pg/mL, consistent with thyrotoxicosis. Anti-TPO and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies were negative. Thyroid scintigraphy demonstrated reduced uptake of the radiotracer, supporting the diagnosis of destructive thyroiditis. FNAC was not performed due to the classical clinical and biochemical presentation.
Based on the clinical history, physical findings, and laboratory results, he was diagnosed with subacute thyroiditis. Initial treatment consisted of pain management and anti-inflammatory therapy with naproxen 500 mg twice daily. Propranolol 40 mg three times daily was started to control symptoms of thyrotoxicosis, including palpitations and tachycardia. Prednisone 30 mg once daily was added after 5 days when significant neck pain persisted and his fever did not resolve with NSAIDs alone. Symptomatic improvement was noted within 72 hours of initiating corticosteroid therapy.
Follow-up at 2 weeks revealed resolution of neck pain and fever. Thyroid function gradually normalized. Prednisone was tapered over the course of 4 weeks, and naproxen was discontinued as symptoms improved. Propranolol was tapered and discontinued as thyrotoxicosis resolved. At the 3-month follow-up, the patient remained asymptomatic with normal TFTs and no evidence of hypothyroidism. No complications or recurrence were observed during subsequent visits."
