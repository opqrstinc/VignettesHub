"A 42-year-old male presented with complaints of intermittent blood in his stool and low-grade fever for the past 3 months. He reported associated abdominal pain primarily in the right lower quadrant, diarrhea occurring 4 to 5 times per day, and unintentional weight loss of approximately 6 kg during this period. His symptoms worsened over the past 3 weeks, with increased stool frequency and more pronounced fatigue. He denied any use of recent medications, alcohol consumption, or history of similar complaints earlier in life. His previous history was significant for duodenal ulcer diagnosed 8 years prior, which resolved with appropriate treatment.
Physical examination revealed a thin, pale, fatigued male in mild distress. His vital signs showed mild tachycardia with a HR of 98 bpm and a temperature of 37.8°C. Abdominal examination demonstrated tenderness in the right lower quadrant without rebound tenderness or guarding. No palpable masses were noted. Mild perianal skin tags were observed without evidence of fissures or abscess. No organomegaly or lymphadenopathy was detected.
Laboratory investigation revealed Hb of 9.8 g/dL, indicative of anemia; WBC was mildly elevated at 11,200/μL, and CRP was significantly elevated at 68 mg/L. CMP indicated hypoalbuminemia with an albumin level of 2.9 g/dL, although renal and liver function tests were within normal limits. Stool studies were negative for occult infections, including Clostridioides difficile toxin and ova and parasites. Colonoscopy demonstrated patchy erythema, ulcers, and cobblestone appearance primarily in the terminal ileum and ascending colon, with normal intervening mucosa. Biopsies revealed transmural inflammation, lymphoid aggregates, crypt distortion, and granuloma formation. MRI enterography confirmed thickened terminal ileum with skip lesions, luminal narrowing, and bowel wall enhancement, suggestive of active inflammation. There was no evidence of strictures or fistulas.
Based on clinical presentation, imaging, endoscopic findings, and histology, a diagnosis of Crohn's disease involving the terminal ileum and ascending colon was established.
Therapeutic intervention included induction therapy with prednisone at 40 mg once daily, followed by a gradual taper over 8 weeks. Maintenance therapy was initiated with adalimumab at 160 mg subcutaneously on day 1, followed by 80 mg at week 2, and 40 mg every 2 weeks thereafter. The patient was also started on azathioprine at 2.0 mg/kg daily for steroid-sparing effects. Supportive care included oral iron supplementation for anemia and nutritional counseling to address hypoalbuminemia and weight loss.
The patient reported significant symptomatic improvement within 4 weeks of treatment initiation, including resolution of bloody stools and reduced abdominal pain. Follow-up at 3 months showed normalization of inflammatory markers and a 4 kg weight gain. Colonoscopic re-evaluation demonstrated marked mucosal healing with the resolution of ulcers and cobblestone appearance. The patient remained in clinical remission at the 6-month follow-up with no adverse reactions to the prescribed medications."
