"A 16-year-old male presented with fatigue, excessive sweating, and dizziness that had persisted for several hours after engaging in outdoor athletic activities under high ambient temperatures. The symptoms initially began as mild exhaustion during practice but progressively worsened, with the patient eventually being unable to continue physical activity. He reported feeling light-headed and developed a throbbing headache before being brought to the hospital by his coach.
On initial examination, his vital signs showed a body temperature of 39.5Â°C, a heart rate of 122 bpm, respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute, and blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg. The patient appeared confused and disoriented, with dry mucous membranes and flushed skin. He exhibited tachycardia and had weak peripheral pulses. No evidence of focal neurological deficits or signs of trauma was noted. His physical examination was otherwise unremarkable.
Laboratory investigations indicated hypernatremia with a serum sodium level of 155 mmol/L, hypokalemia with a serum potassium level of 3.2 mmol/L, and a serum creatinine level of 1.5 mg/dL, suggestive of dehydration and renal hypoperfusion. Serum CK was elevated at 1,200 U/L, consistent with muscle breakdown. Arterial blood gas analysis showed metabolic acidosis with a pH of 7.25 and a lactate level of 4.5 mmol/L. Additional investigations revealed increased AST and ALT levels, indicating mild hepatic stress.
The patient was diagnosed with heatstroke based on clinical presentation and laboratory findings. Immediate treatment was initiated to lower body temperature and address circulatory insufficiency. Rapid cooling was achieved using evaporative cooling methods, including misting the body with cool water and continuous use of fans. Ice packs were placed in the axillae and groin. The patient was also given IV normal saline at a rate of 500 mL/hour for the first two hours to correct hypovolemia and electrolyte imbalance. Potassium chloride was added to the saline infusion to correct hypokalemia.
After initial stabilization, IV fluids were tapered to 250 mL/hour, and serum electrolytes were closely monitored. Further potassium supplementation was administered orally when serum K+ normalized to 3.5 mmol/L. Antipyretics such as acetaminophen were not used, as they were deemed ineffective in the treatment of non-pyrogenic hyperthermia. No antibiotics were administered, as there was no evidence of an infection.
Over the next 24 hours, the patient showed gradual improvement with a return of mental clarity and normalization of vital signs. His CK levels decreased, and kidney function tests returned to baseline over the following 48 hours. He was discharged on the third day with recommendations to avoid strenuous physical activity in extreme heat and to maintain adequate hydration during similar circumstances in the future."
