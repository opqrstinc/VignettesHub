"A 52-year-old female presented with complaints of dry skin and persistent cold intolerance for the past six months. She stated that these symptoms gradually worsened over time, alongside feelings of fatigue, weight gain despite a reduced appetite, and occasional episodes of constipation. She reported experiencing mild depression and difficulty concentrating, which she attributed to stress. She denied heat intolerance, palpitations, or changes in hair or nail growth. Her medical history was significant for T2DM, diagnosed five years earlier, managed with metformin 500 mg PO BID. No history of autoimmune conditions or thyroid disorders was noted in her family.
On physical examination, she appeared overweight with puffy facial features and coarse-appearing skin, particularly on her extremities. Her HR was 58 bpm, and her BP was 132/84 mmHg. Her thyroid was diffusely enlarged, firm, and non-tender on palpation, with no palpable nodules. Other findings included dry, cool skin and delayed relaxation phase of the ankle reflexes. No goiter-associated compressive symptoms, such as dyspnea or dysphagia, were reported. Cardiac and pulmonary examinations were unremarkable.
Laboratory studies revealed an elevated TSH level of 18.6 mIU/L and a decreased free T4 of 0.6 ng/dL, consistent with primary hypothyroidism. Anti-TPO Ab levels were markedly elevated at 750 IU/mL, and TG Ab levels were also increased, supporting a diagnosis of autoimmune thyroiditis. FPG was 126 mg/dL, and HbA1c was 6.7%, consistent with her known diabetes. Lipid panel showed elevated total cholesterol (256 mg/dL) and LDL-C (155 mg/dL). CBC and CMP were within normal limits. Thyroid US demonstrated diffuse hypoechogenicity without focal lesions, nodules, or increased vascularity.
Based on clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and imaging, she was diagnosed with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Levothyroxine therapy was initiated at a starting dose of 75 mcg PO daily, adjusted based on her weight and symptom severity. She was advised to take the medication in the morning on an empty stomach and to avoid concurrent intake of calcium- or iron-containing supplements. Metformin was continued for her diabetes, and she was referred for nutritional counseling to address both glucose control and weight management. She was also advised to monitor and report any worsening symptoms of hypothyroidism or potential side effects of levothyroxine.
At her six-week follow-up, she reported improved energy levels, resolution of cold intolerance, softer skin texture, and partial weight stabilization. Repeat TSH testing showed normalization at 2.8 mIU/L, and her free T4 was 1.1 ng/dL. Her lipid profile also improved, with total cholesterol reduced to 210 mg/dL and LDL-C to 130 mg/dL. Her HbA1c remained stable at 6.6%. The levothyroxine dose was maintained, and she was instructed to return in three months for further monitoring."
