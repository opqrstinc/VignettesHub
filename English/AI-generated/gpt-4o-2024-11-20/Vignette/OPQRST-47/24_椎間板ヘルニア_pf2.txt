"A 38-year-old male presented with complaints of worsening low back pain, numbness in his right leg, and difficulty walking over the past two weeks. He reported that his symptoms began as mild discomfort in the lower back approximately three months prior, which he attributed to prolonged sitting at work. However, the pain gradually intensified and radiated down the posterior aspect of his right leg to the calf. He described the sensation as sharp, particularly exacerbated by activities such as bending forward, prolonged standing, and walking more than a short distance. He denied any history of recent trauma, fever, or bowel/bladder dysfunction. He had a previous history of intermittent low back pain, which he had managed conservatively with over-the-counter analgesics and rest.
On physical examination, the patient appeared to have an antalgic gait. Inspection revealed decreased range of motion in the lumbar spine, particularly with forward flexion. Palpation of the lumbar paraspinal muscles elicited localized tenderness without muscle spasm. Neurological examination demonstrated decreased strength (4/5) in the right ankle dorsiflexors, diminished sensation over the lateral calf and dorsum of the foot, and a positive straight leg raise test on the right at 40 degrees with reproduction of radicular pain. Reflexes were diminished at the right ankle (Achilles reflex) compared to the contralateral side. No signs of upper motor neuron involvement or cauda equina syndrome, such as perineal numbness, were detected.
An MRI of the lumbosacral spine was performed, which revealed a large herniation of the L4-L5 intervertebral disc. The disc protrusion was observed to compress the right L5 nerve root. No evidence of spinal cord compression or other abnormalities was identified. Plain radiographs of the lumbar spine showed no vertebral fractures, alignment abnormalities, or significant degenerative changes. Routine laboratory tests, including a CBC and CRP, were within normal limits.
The diagnosis of L4-L5 disc herniation with right-sided L5 radiculopathy was made. Owing to the severity of the patient's symptoms and their significant impact on his daily activities, a combination of pharmacological therapy and physical rehabilitation was initiated. He was prescribed oral NSAIDs (naproxen 500 mg twice daily) for pain and inflammation, as well as a short course of oral corticosteroids (prednisone 40 mg daily tapered over 10 days). An oral muscle relaxant (cyclobenzaprine 10 mg at bedtime) was added to address lumbar muscle discomfort. The patient was also advised to engage in a structured physical therapy program focusing on core strengthening and flexibility exercises, under the supervision of a licensed physiotherapist.
Within two weeks of initiating treatment, the patient reported moderate improvement in his symptoms, including reduced pain intensity and improved mobility. During follow-up at one month, his neurological deficits had substantially recovered, with strength and sensation in the right leg nearing baseline levels. He was counseled on ergonomic modifications and advised to avoid heavy lifting and prolonged sitting to prevent recurrence. Surgical intervention, including microdiscectomy, was discussed as a possible option if conservative management failed; however, at the time of his last follow-up, it had not been pursued due to his satisfactory response to conservative treatment."
