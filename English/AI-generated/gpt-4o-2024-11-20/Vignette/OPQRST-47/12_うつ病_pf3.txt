"The patient was a 52-year-old male with a history of hyperlipidemia, presenting with a primary complaint of persistent headache, nausea, depressed mood, diminished concentration, and reduced appetite. Symptoms began insidiously approximately three months prior to consultation and progressively worsened over time. He reported difficulty in performing daily tasks, decreased interest in previously enjoyable activities, disrupted sleep with early morning awakening, and weight loss of approximately 5 kg over two months. No recent significant social or occupational stressors were noted, and there was no reported history of substance use or family history of psychiatric disorders.
On physical examination, the patient appeared fatigued and had a flat affect. Vitals were within normal limits. Neurological examination and other systemic evaluations were unremarkable. However, the patient displayed signs of psychomotor slowing and was visibly distressed when discussing his symptoms.
Laboratory investigations were conducted to exclude organic causes and included CBC, CMP, TSH, vitamin B12 levels, and folate levels, all of which were within normal limits. Imaging studies, including a brain MRI, revealed no structural or pathological abnormalities. Based on symptomatology and exclusion of other medical causes, the patient met the diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) as per DSM-5 guidelines.
Treatment was initiated with sertraline, starting at a dose of 25 mg daily for the first week to assess tolerability, and subsequently increased to 50 mg daily. Psychoeducation regarding the nature of MDD and expectations regarding pharmacological therapy was provided. Additionally, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) was recommended, focusing on identifying and restructuring negative thought patterns.
Two weeks after initiation of treatment, the patient reported mild improvement in mood and concentration, though headaches and early fatigue persisted. At the four-week follow-up, the sertraline dose was increased to 100 mg daily due to suboptimal symptom relief. The patient demonstrated further functional improvements, including increased engagement at work and resumption of regular meal intake. By the eighth week, he reported significant alleviation of depressive symptoms, improved sleep quality, and resolution of somatic complaints. Throughout the treatment, no significant adverse reactions to sertraline were observed. The patient continued on maintenance therapy and remained adherent to CBT sessions, achieving sustained symptom remission over the following months."
