"A 78-year-old male, with a past medical history of dyslipidemia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), presented with progressive memory loss over the past two years. His family reported that he had increasing difficulty recalling recent events, forgetting appointments, and misplacing objects. These cognitive difficulties interfered with daily activities, resulting in challenges managing finances and preparing meals independently. Over the previous six months, he developed occasional disorientation, describing episodes of confusion about time and location. He denied any history of head trauma, seizures, or recent infections.
On physical examination, vital signs were within normal limits. No focal neurological deficits were noted. Cranial nerve examination was unremarkable. Motor and sensory function remained intact. However, cognitive assessment revealed significant deficits, including impaired short-term memory tested through recall tasks, reduced attention span, and difficulty completing tasks requiring executive function. MMSE (Mini-Mental State Examination) scored 21/30, indicating mild cognitive impairment. Gait assessment showed normal ambulation without significant postural instability.
Laboratory tests, including CBC, CMP, TSH, and serum B12 levels, showed no abnormalities. Neuroimaging performed via brain MRI revealed diffuse cerebral atrophy, particularly in the medial temporal lobe and hippocampal regions, consistent with Alzheimer's disease (AD). FDG-PET imaging demonstrated hypometabolism in the parietal and temporal lobes. Lumbar puncture results identified decreased levels of Î²-amyloid 42 and increased levels of total and phosphorylated tau proteins in the CSF, further supporting the clinical suspicion of AD.
The diagnosis of AD was established based on the progressive cognitive decline, neuroimaging findings, and supportive CSF biomarkers following established diagnostic criteria. 
Pharmacological management was initiated with donepezil at an initial dose of 5 mg daily, which was increased to 10 mg daily after four weeks, aiming to improve cognitive function and slow disease progression. Additionally, memantine was started at 5 mg daily and titrated to 10 mg twice daily over three weeks. The patient was educated about lifestyle modifications, including engaging in cognitive stimulation, regular physical activity, and maintaining social interactions. He was also referred to a neurologist for long-term follow-up and enrolled in a caregiver support program for assistance in managing his condition.
Over the subsequent six months of follow-up, the patient's condition stabilized with no significant further cognitive decline noted. Family members reported slight improvements in his ability to engage in conversations and complete simple tasks with assistance. No significant adverse effects from the medications were observed, except for occasional mild nausea in the early phase of donepezil therapy, which resolved after dose adjustment."
