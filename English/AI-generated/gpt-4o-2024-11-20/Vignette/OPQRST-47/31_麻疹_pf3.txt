"A previously healthy 4-year-old female presented with a complaint of fever, cough, and conjunctivitis. Symptoms initially began 4 days prior with a high-grade fever accompanied by a dry cough. On the second day of illness, she developed conjunctival erythema and photophobia. On the third day, her mother noticed small white spots on the buccal mucosa, later identified as Koplik spots. The patient had no history of recent travel or known exposure to infectious individuals. Immunization records revealed no documentation of a prior MMR vaccine.
Physical examination revealed an irritable-appearing child with a temperature of 39.4°C, tachycardia of 120 bpm, and tachypnea at 24 breaths/min. Conjunctival injection with associated watery discharge was present bilaterally. The buccal mucosa showed scattered white spots on an erythematous base. A maculopapular rash was observed, beginning on the face and gradually spreading caudally to the trunk and extremities. Auscultation of the chest indicated mild rhonchi bilaterally, though no crackles or wheezing were noted. No lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly was identified.
Laboratory evaluation demonstrated leukopenia with a WBC count of 3,100/μL and an elevated lymphocyte percentage. CRP and ESR were mildly elevated. Serum serology confirmed the diagnosis, showing the presence of measles-specific IgM antibodies. Nasopharyngeal swab PCR detected RNA of the measles virus, further confirming the diagnosis.
The clinical presentation, including fever, cough, conjunctivitis, Koplik spots, and a progressive maculopapular rash, was consistent with a classic case of measles. Considering the patient's lack of prior MMR vaccination and laboratory confirmation, measles was diagnosed.
Treatment was initiated with supportive care, including adequate hydration and antipyretics such as acetaminophen (10 mg/kg per dose every 6 hours as needed). Vitamin A supplementation was administered as per WHO guidelines, with a dose of 200,000 IU orally for 2 consecutive days. Strict isolation measures were implemented to prevent nosocomial transmission.
Over the subsequent 5 days, the patient's fever resolved, and the rash began to fade, initially desquamating from the face. Cough persisted but showed gradual improvement. Follow-up care included counseling the caregiver on the importance of immunization, ensuring the child is vaccinated against measles and other preventable diseases. The patient recovered fully without complications such as pneumonia or encephalitis."
