"A 45-year-old male presented with a chief complaint of acute pain and swelling in his left great toe. The symptoms began abruptly 24 hours prior to presentation, initially as mild discomfort that progressed to severe pain, limiting his ability to ambulate. He reported no recent trauma, fever, or systemic symptoms. His medical history was significant for hypertension and dyslipidemia, for which he was being treated with lisinopril 10 mg once daily and atorvastatin 20 mg once daily, respectively. He denied a history of prior similar episodes or known hyperuricemia. He reported regular alcohol consumption, predominantly beer, averaging 2-3 drinks per day. There was no family history of gout or rheumatologic diseases.
On physical examination, the left first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint was markedly swollen, erythematous, warm to the touch, and exquisitely tender. Palpation and passive movement of the joint elicited severe pain. The overlying skin was tense and shiny but intact. There was no evidence of tophi or involvement of other joints. The remainder of the physical examination was unremarkable.
Laboratory investigations revealed an elevated serum uric acid level of 8.9 mg/dL. Inflammatory markers were also elevated, including ESR at 45 mm/hr and CRP at 12 mg/L. Renal function tests demonstrated a serum creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL with an estimated GFR of 90 mL/min, consistent with normal kidney function. A CBC showed mild leukocytosis with a WBC count of 12,500/ÂµL but no left shift. Blood glucose and lipid panel results were unchanged from previous evaluations. Radiographs of the left foot showed soft tissue swelling around the first MTP joint without evidence of joint erosion or chondrocalcinosis. An arthrocentesis of the affected joint was performed, revealing 2 mL of cloudy yellow synovial fluid. Microscopic analysis demonstrated negatively birefringent, needle-shaped monosodium urate crystals under polarized light, confirming the diagnosis of acute gout.
Initial treatment consisted of oral colchicine at a loading dose of 1.2 mg, followed by 0.6 mg one hour later. The patient was then prescribed colchicine 0.6 mg twice daily for prophylaxis. In addition, indomethacin was initiated at a dose of 50 mg three times daily for 5 days to control the acute inflammation. He was advised to maintain adequate hydration and avoid alcohol and purine-rich foods. 
During follow-up one week later, the patient reported significant improvement in symptoms. Swelling and erythema of the left great toe had resolved, and he no longer experienced pain with ambulation. Indomethacin was discontinued at the conclusion of therapy, and he continued colchicine prophylaxis. Serum uric acid levels were scheduled for reevaluation in 4 weeks, with plans to initiate urate-lowering therapy, such as allopurinol, if hyperuricemia persisted and recurrent attacks occurred."
