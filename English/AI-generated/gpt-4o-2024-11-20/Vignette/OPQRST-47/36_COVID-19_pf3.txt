"A 67-year-old female presented with a 5-day history of worsening dry cough, generalized fatigue, and progressive dyspnea. She reported the initial onset of mild fatigue and a low-grade fever, which subsided on the second day. However, her cough persisted and became more frequent, accompanied by increasing shortness of breath. She denied any chest pain, hemoptysis, or palpitations. There was no recent history of travel or known exposure to confirmed COVID-19 cases. Her past medical history included type 2 diabetes mellitus, which was managed with metformin (1,000 mg twice daily). She had no history of chronic respiratory or cardiac conditions. 
On physical examination, her temperature was 38.3°C, BP was 128/74 mmHg, HR was 96 bpm, RR was 22 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation on room air was 90%. She appeared fatigued but alert and oriented. Lung auscultation revealed bilateral inspiratory crackles predominantly at the lung bases, with decreased air entry. No wheezing or signs of fluid overload, such as peripheral edema or elevated jugular venous pressure, were observed. 
Laboratory findings demonstrated leukopenia (WBC 4,000/µL) with relative lymphopenia (absolute lymphocyte count 900/µL). CRP and D-dimer were elevated at 12.3 mg/dL and 2,100 ng/mL, respectively. Serum ferritin was markedly elevated at 800 ng/mL. Procalcitonin levels were normal. ABG on room air showed a pH of 7.44, PaCO2 of 35 mmHg, PaO2 of 65 mmHg, and an HCO3- of 23 mEq/L. RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 performed on a nasopharyngeal swab tested positive. Chest CT revealed bilateral, patchy ground-glass opacities in the peripheral and posterior regions, consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia. No pulmonary embolism was identified. 
The patient was diagnosed with moderate COVID-19 pneumonia with hypoxemia. Treatment was initiated with oxygen therapy using a low-flow nasal cannula at 4 L/min, which improved SpO2 to 94%. She received dexamethasone 6 mg IV once daily for 10 days and remdesivir 200 mg IV on the first day, followed by 100 mg IV daily for four additional days. Metformin was temporarily discontinued due to the increased risk of lactic acidosis in the setting of acute illness. She was provided enoxaparin 40 mg SC daily for thromboprophylaxis. Blood glucose levels were managed with regular insulin administered by sliding scale. 
During hospitalization, the patient showed gradual improvement in symptoms. Fever resolved by day four of treatment, and her oxygen requirement decreased by day seven. By day 10, she was weaned off supplemental oxygen, and oxygen saturation remained stable at 96% on room air. Repeat inflammatory markers, including CRP and D-dimer, showed significant improvement. A follow-up chest X-ray revealed partial resolution of ground-glass opacities. She was discharged home on day 12 with instructions to continue glucose monitoring and follow-up with her primary care physician. Pulmonary rehabilitation was recommended to address any lingering dyspnea or fatigue. "
