"A 68-year-old male presented with chronic cough, sputum production, and progressive dyspnea on exertion over the past 5 years. The symptoms had gradually worsened, limiting his ability to perform daily activities. He reported frequent episodes of nocturnal symptoms and occasional wheezing. He denied any hemoptysis, chest pain, fever, or weight loss. His medical history was significant for hyperlipidemia, for which he had been taking atorvastatin 20 mg daily. He had a 40-pack-year smoking history but had quit smoking 5 years prior to presentation. He had no history of asthma, tuberculosis, or previous lung infections. Family history was non-contributory. He was not on any regular inhaler therapy prior to the presentation.
On physical examination, he appeared comfortable at rest but required frequent pauses to catch his breath while providing his history. Vital signs showed a respiratory rate of 24 breaths/min, a resting SpO2 of 93% on room air, and no fever. Chest auscultation revealed bilateral expiratory wheezes and diminished breath sounds, more prominent in the bases. No signs of cyanosis, clubbing, or significant peripheral edema were noted. Cardiovascular examination was unremarkable.
Pulmonary function tests demonstrated an FEV1/FVC ratio of 60% of the predicted value, consistent with airflow limitation. Post-bronchodilator testing showed minimal reversibility, with an FEV1 increase of 5%. The FEV1 was measured at 45% of the predicted value, corresponding to GOLD stage 3 COPD. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed mild hypoxemia with a PaO2 of 70 mmHg and no evidence of hypercapnia. Chest X-ray showed hyperinflated lung fields, flattening of the diaphragms, and an increased retrosternal airspace. A high-resolution CT scan ruled out other significant pathologies but confirmed emphysematous changes, predominantly in the upper lobes. Laboratory results showed no significant abnormalities except for a WBC count of 9,800/μL; eosinophilia was not present. Testing for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency ruled out this genetic contribution to his symptoms.
The diagnosis of COPD, GOLD stage 3, was established based on clinical presentation, smoking history, and spirometric findings. The patient was initiated on maintenance pharmacotherapy with tiotropium 18 μg inhaled once daily and a combination of fluticasone 250 μg with salmeterol 50 μg inhaled twice daily via a metered-dose inhaler (MDI). Albuterol 90 μg per inhalation was prescribed as needed for symptom relief. Smoking cessation counseling was reinforced, though he had already successfully quit. Influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations were administered during the visit. Pulmonary rehabilitation was recommended, emphasizing exercise training and education on energy conservation techniques.
Over the following 3 months, he demonstrated significant symptom improvement, reporting fewer episodes of dyspnea and better exercise tolerance. His use of rescue albuterol decreased to once or twice per week. Follow-up spirometry showed no significant change, as expected, but the patient reported improved quality of life. No acute exacerbations occurred during this period. Long-term management plans included continued inhaler therapy, regular follow-up appointments at 6-month intervals, and ongoing encouragement of lifestyle modifications, including a daily walking regimen."
