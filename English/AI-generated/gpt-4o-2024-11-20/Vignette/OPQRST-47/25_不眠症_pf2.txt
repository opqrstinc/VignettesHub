"A 48-year-old male presented with a chief complaint of difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep, which had been progressively worsening over the past three months. He described experiencing frequent awakenings during the night and feeling unrefreshed upon awakening in the morning. He reported sleeping, on average, less than 4-5 hours per night, despite having adequate opportunity and environment for sleep. He also noted fatigue, irritability, and difficulty concentrating during the day, which were impacting his occupational performance. He denied any history of similar symptoms in the past. There was no evidence of significant psychosocial stressors or recent life changes, although he acknowledged mild anxiety regarding his inability to sleep. He denied using caffeine, alcohol, or other substances that could interfere with sleep. He had no significant PMH, and no history of psychiatric or neurologic disorders. He was not taking any medications or supplements regularly.
Physical examination was unremarkable. His BMI was 24.2 kg/mÂ². Cardiovascular, respiratory, neurologic, and abdominal examinations were normal. His BP was 126/78 mmHg, and his pulse was 72 bpm. No signs of thyromegaly or tremors were observed. Psychiatric evaluation revealed no overt mood or anxiety disorders.
Laboratory tests, including CBC, CMP, TSH, and free T4, were performed to exclude potential secondary causes of insomnia and were within normal limits. Polysomnography was not pursued, as there were no features suggestive of sleep apnea, periodic limb movement disorder, or other specific sleep disorders. The patient met the diagnostic criteria for primary insomnia (chronic insomnia disorder) as per the DSM-5, given the duration and nature of his symptoms and their negative impact on daytime functioning.
Treatment was initiated with cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) as the first-line approach, focusing on sleep hygiene education, stimulus control, and sleep restriction therapy. Additionally, pharmacologic therapy was started with eszopiclone 2 mg, taken orally once nightly, approximately 30 minutes before bedtime, as a short-term adjunct to improve sleep onset and maintenance. The patient was advised to avoid daytime naps, limit screen exposure before bed, and maintain a consistent sleep schedule. Follow-up was scheduled for two weeks to assess response and adjust the treatment plan if necessary.
At the two-week follow-up, the patient reported noticeable improvement in both sleep duration and quality. He was able to sleep approximately 6-7 hours per night with fewer night awakenings. Daytime symptoms of fatigue and difficulty concentrating had also reduced significantly. He was counseled to continue CBT-I sessions and maintain the behavioral changes. Eszopiclone was continued at the same dose with the plan to taper off gradually over 6-8 weeks. No significant AEs related to the medication were reported during this period. Further follow-up and long-term management strategies were discussed, emphasizing nonpharmacologic approaches to sustain the improvements."
