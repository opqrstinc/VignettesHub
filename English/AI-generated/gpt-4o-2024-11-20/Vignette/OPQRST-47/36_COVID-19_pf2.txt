"A 17-year-old male presented with a 3-day history of fever, dyspnea, and a newly developed loss of taste. The fever began abruptly, reaching a peak of 39.2°C, and was accompanied by mild fatigue. Dyspnea gradually worsened over the prior 24 hours, limiting daily activities. He denied cough, chest pain, or sore throat but described an acute onset of anosmia and ageusia starting on the second day of symptoms. He had no significant medical history, no history of smoking, and no known allergies. He reported no recent travel but confirmed close contact with an individual diagnosed with COVID-19 one week prior.
Upon physical examination, the patient appeared mildly distressed. Vital signs included a temperature of 38.7°C, HR 112 bpm, BP 118/72 mmHg, RR 22/min, and SpO2 94% on room air. Auscultation revealed fine bilateral crackles at the lung bases, with no wheezing or rhonchi. The patient exhibited no significant pharyngeal erythema or cervical lymphadenopathy. No rashes or cyanosis were noted.
Laboratory findings revealed leukopenia with a WBC count of 3,800/μL, lymphopenia at 14%, and an elevated CRP at 9.2 mg/dL. D-dimer was mildly elevated at 600 ng/mL, LDH was 280 U/L, and ferritin measured 500 ng/mL. Liver and renal function tests were within normal limits. Arterial blood gas analysis showed pH 7.43, PaO2 68 mmHg, and PaCO2 36 mmHg. PCR for SARS-CoV-2 using a nasopharyngeal swab returned positive. A chest X-ray revealed bilateral patchy infiltrates, predominantly in the lower lobes, suggestive of atypical pneumonia.
Based on the clinical presentation, diagnostic findings, and recent exposure history, the patient was diagnosed with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 pneumonia. The patient was admitted for supportive care and monitoring due to his dyspnea and oxygen desaturation.
Treatment included remdesivir at a dosage of 200 mg IV on the first day, followed by 100 mg IV daily for four additional days. Dexamethasone was started at 6 mg orally once daily for 10 days. Supplemental oxygen was initially provided via nasal cannula at 2 L/min to maintain SpO2 above 92%. Antipyretics, such as acetaminophen at 500 mg every 6 hours as needed, were administered for fever control. Prophylactic anticoagulation with enoxaparin at 40 mg subcutaneously once daily was initiated due to elevated D-dimer levels and the risk of thromboembolism.
Over the course of hospitalization, the patient’s fever subsided by day 3 of treatment, and his dyspnea improved gradually. By day 5, SpO2 was stable at 96% on room air, and oxygen supplementation was discontinued. Repeat lab tests showed improved inflammatory markers, with CRP reduced to 1.5 mg/dL and normalization of lymphocyte counts. The patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout his stay. He was discharged on day 7 with instructions for home quarantine and follow-up evaluation. Residual anosmia and ageusia upon discharge were noted as ongoing but non-distressing."
