"A 28-year-old female presented with a complaint of persistent fatigue, episodes of dizziness, and brittle, concave-shaped nails over the past three months. She reported progressive worsening of her symptoms, which began insidiously. She denied any significant medical or surgical history. Her diet consisted primarily of vegetarian meals, with a limited intake of iron-rich foods. She denied gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain, melena, or hematemesis. There was no family history of anemia or other hematological disorders. She reported regular menstrual cycles, though her menses were heavy and lasted for 6-7 days.
On physical examination, her vital signs were within normal limits except for a mild tachycardia (HR 96 bpm). She appeared pale, particularly over the conjunctivae. There was mild spooning of her fingernails, consistent with koilonychia. No lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, or splenomegaly was observed. Cardiovascular, respiratory, and abdominal examinations were otherwise unremarkable. Neurological examination revealed no deficits.
Laboratory investigations revealed a Hb level of 8.2 g/dL, an MCV of 70 fL, and a low reticulocyte count. Serum iron was 25 μg/dL, TIBC was elevated at 450 μg/dL, and ferritin was decreased at 8 ng/mL. Peripheral blood smear demonstrated microcytic and hypochromic red cells. Further workup, including stool guaiac test and colonoscopy, was negative for occult gastrointestinal bleeding. Thyroid function tests and vitamin B12 levels were within normal ranges, ruling out alternative causes of anemia.
Based on the above findings, she was diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia, likely secondary to chronic blood loss due to heavy menstruation combined with insufficient dietary iron intake.
She was treated with oral ferrous sulfate at a dose of 325 mg once daily, providing 65 mg of elemental iron. Vitamin C supplementation at a dose of 500 mg daily was also initiated to enhance iron absorption. She was counseled on incorporating dietary sources of iron, such as fortified cereals, legumes, and leafy green vegetables. After one month of treatment, her fatigue and dizziness improved significantly. Repeat labs showed an increase in Hb to 10.4 g/dL and a ferritin level of 25 ng/mL. She continued iron supplementation for a total of six months, at which point her Hb levels normalized to 13.6 g/dL and serum ferritin to 50 ng/mL. Adherence to dietary modifications was emphasized to prevent recurrence."
