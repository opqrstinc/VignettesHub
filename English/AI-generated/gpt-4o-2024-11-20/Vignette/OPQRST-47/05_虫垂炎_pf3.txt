"A 42-year-old male presented with a 24-hour history of worsening right lower abdominal pain and anorexia. He described the pain as dull initially, which later became sharp and localized to the right lower quadrant (RLQ). He denied any episodes of vomiting but reported mild nausea. There was no history of fever, diarrhea, or constipation. He had no previous abdominal surgeries or gastrointestinal disorders, but his medical history was significant for hypertension, for which he was taking losartan 50 mg once daily.
On physical examination, his vital signs revealed a low-grade fever with a temperature of 37.8°C, a heart rate of 92 bpm, and BP of 138/86 mmHg. Abdominal examination demonstrated tenderness localized to the RLQ with rebound tenderness and guarding. There was a positive McBurney's point tenderness and Rovsing’s sign. Other systemic examinations were unremarkable.
Laboratory investigations revealed an elevated WBC count of 14,400/μL with a left shift (neutrophils 87%). CRP was elevated at 11.6 mg/dL. Serum electrolytes, renal function, and liver function tests were within normal limits. Urinalysis was normal, and a pregnancy test was not applicable. Abdominal ultrasonography demonstrated a non-compressible tubular structure in the RLQ, measuring 7 mm in diameter with surrounding echogenic fat, consistent with acute appendicitis. CT with contrast confirmed the diagnosis, showing an inflamed appendix with periappendiceal fat stranding but no evidence of perforation or abscess.
The patient was diagnosed with uncomplicated acute appendicitis. He was admitted for urgent laparoscopic appendectomy. Preoperatively, he received a single dose of ceftriaxone 2 g IV and metronidazole 500 mg IV for prophylaxis against surgical site infections. The laparoscopic procedure was uneventful, and the inflamed appendix was successfully removed. Intraoperative findings confirmed the diagnosis, with the appendix being inflamed but not perforated. Postoperative recovery was smooth, and he was started on a 5-day course of oral antibiotics with amoxicillin-clavulanate 875 mg/125 mg twice daily. Pain control was achieved with acetaminophen 1 g every 6 hours as needed. 
By the third postoperative day, the patient had resumed a normal diet and was ambulating without difficulty. He was discharged home on postoperative day three with instructions for follow-up in one week. At his follow-up visit, he reported no complications, and the surgical site had healed well. All symptoms were resolved without further issues. "
