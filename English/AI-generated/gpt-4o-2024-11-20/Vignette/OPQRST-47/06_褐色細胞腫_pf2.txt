"A 41-year-old female presented with intermittent, severe headaches and episodes of profuse sweating over a period of three months. The symptoms occurred without any apparent triggers, lasting for 20 to 40 minutes each time, and were sporadically accompanied by palpitations and anxiety. She noted no clear exacerbating or relieving factors. Her medical history included hypothyroidism, for which she had been taking levothyroxine 75 mcg daily for the past 5 years. She reported no family history of endocrine or cardiovascular disorders and denied the use of tobacco, alcohol, or recreational drugs.
On physical examination, her blood pressure was measured at 160/95 mmHg, with significant variability during repeated measurements, including episodes of marked hypertension exceeding 180/110 mmHg. Her pulse rate ranged from 90 to 120 bpm, and no arrhythmias were detected during auscultation. The examination revealed no significant findings on abdominal inspection or palpation. Cardiopulmonary and neurological examinations were unremarkable. Cervical inspection showed no thyroid enlargement or masses. She exhibited no orthostatic hypotension, skin changes, or evidence of hyperpigmentation.
Laboratory investigations demonstrated elevated plasma free metanephrine at 480 pg/mL (normal < 65 pg/mL) and normetanephrine at 3,200 pg/mL (normal < 200 pg/mL). 24-hour urinary fractionated metanephrines were similarly elevated. Thyroid function tests showed normal TSH and free T4, consistent with stable management of hypothyroidism. Serum glucose and HbA1c remained within normal limits. ECG was normal, while echocardiography excluded structural cardiac abnormalities. A CT of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a well-circumscribed, 4.2 cm lesion in the left adrenal gland with contrast enhancement consistent with a pheochromocytoma.
The diagnosis of pheochromocytoma was confirmed based on biochemical and imaging findings. Genetic testing for hereditary conditions such as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 or von Hippel-Lindau syndrome was negative.
Preoperatively, she was started on alpha-adrenergic blockade with phenoxybenzamine at an initial dose of 10 mg twice daily, titrated over 10 days to 30 mg twice daily. Adequate alpha blockade was achieved, as evidenced by controlled blood pressure without hypertensive surges and absence of significant side effects. Beta-blockade with propranolol, at a dose of 20 mg three times daily, was introduced after 7 days of alpha-adrenergic blockade to control tachycardia. She was advised to follow a high-sodium diet to mitigate orthostatic hypotension induced by the medication. Surgical intervention was planned after stabilization.
She underwent a laparoscopic left adrenalectomy with no intraoperative complications. Histopathology confirmed a pheochromocytoma. Postoperatively, her BP normalized, and palpitations, headaches, and sweating episodes resolved completely. Plasma metanephrine levels assessed one month after surgery showed a significant reduction to within normal range. Follow-up continued without recurrence of symptoms or biochemical abnormalities at six months. She was instructed to maintain annual biochemical surveillance to monitor for potential recurrence."
