"A 46-year-old male presented with a 2-month history of progressive ptosis, more pronounced in the evening, and generalized fatigue that worsened with activity. He reported difficulty keeping his eyes open and experienced intermittent diplopia during prolonged tasks. There was no associated pain, and the symptoms improved after rest. He denied dysphagia, dysarthria, or respiratory symptoms. His past medical history included hypertension, for which he was on amlodipine 10 mg daily. He had no prior surgeries and no family history of neuromuscular disorders.
Physical examination revealed bilateral ptosis, more noticeable on the left side, and asymmetric weakness in extraocular movements without nystagmus. Orbicularis oculi and orbicularis oris demonstrated fatigable weakness. On repetitive eye closure, the strength diminished further. Limb muscle strength was slightly reduced (graded 4/5 on manual testing), particularly in the proximal muscles, but deep tendon reflexes were preserved. No muscle atrophy or sensory deficits were observed, and cranial nerve examination was otherwise unremarkable.
Initial laboratory investigations, including CBC, CMP, and thyroid function tests, were within normal limits. AChR antibody testing revealed elevated anti-AChR antibodies. Electromyography with repetitive nerve stimulation showed a decremental response of greater than 10% in the deltoid and trapezius muscles. A CT scan of the chest demonstrated an anterior mediastinal mass consistent with a thymoma. These findings confirmed the diagnosis of MG, likely secondary to thymoma.
Treatment was initiated with pyridostigmine 60 mg orally q6h, resulting in partial symptomatic relief within days. Prednisone 20 mg daily was added for immune modulation, and the dose was gradually increased to 60 mg over 2 weeks. Concurrently, azathioprine at 50 mg daily was initiated for long-term immunosuppression. The patient was counseled regarding the need for frequent monitoring of liver function tests and CBC due to azathioprineâ€™s potential adverse effects. Additionally, the patient underwent thymectomy 4 weeks after stabilization of symptoms. Histopathology confirmed a type AB thymoma without malignant features.
Postoperatively, he showed significant improvement in symptoms. Pyridostigmine was continued, with a dose adjusted to 60 mg q8h, and prednisone was tapered over several months as symptoms and AChR antibody titers declined. Azathioprine was titrated to 100 mg daily based on tolerance. Over a follow-up period of 12 months, his symptoms remained well-controlled with no further exacerbations. A repeat chest CT at 6 months post-thymectomy showed no evidence of recurrence, and follow-up EMG demonstrated improvement in neuromuscular transmission."
