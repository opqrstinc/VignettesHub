"A 68-year-old male presented with a chief complaint of resting tremor of the right hand, which he first noticed approximately six months earlier. The tremor was initially subtle and occurred sporadically, but it progressively worsened in frequency and amplitude over time. Around the same period, he noticed an intermittent sensation of stiffness and discomfort in his lower extremities, accompanied by a subtle shuffling of gait. He reported occasional difficulty initiating movement, especially when getting up from a chair, but he denied any significant falls. His family noticed a reduction in his facial expression and a softer tone of voice during conversations. There was no history of head injury, neurodegenerative disease, or exposure to dopamine-depleting medications. His medical history was significant for well-controlled hypertension, managed with amlodipine 10 mg once daily. He denied smoking, alcohol use, or illicit drug use.
On physical examination, a resting tremor of the right hand was noted at a frequency of approximately 4â€“6 Hz, which diminished with voluntary movement and worsened with emotional stress. Rigidity was detected during passive movement of the right wrist and elbow, demonstrating cogwheel characteristics. Bradykinesia was prominent, particularly on the right side, as evidenced by slowed finger tapping and reduced arm swing during ambulation. Postural reflexes were diminished on testing, although he was able to maintain balance unaided. Gait examination revealed a stooped posture, reduced stride length, and shuffling movements with decreased bilateral arm swing. There were no cerebellar signs or motor weakness. Cranial nerve examination, sensory testing, and deep tendon reflexes were within normal limits.
Laboratory evaluation, including CBC, CMP, and thyroid function tests, showed no abnormalities. Brain MRI revealed no evidence of structural lesions, infarction, or normal pressure hydrocephalus. DaTscan using [123I] ioflupane SPECT showed significantly reduced dopamine transporter uptake in the left striatum, consistent with a dopaminergic neurodegenerative process. Based on clinical history, physical examination, and imaging findings, he was diagnosed with idiopathic PD.
Treatment was initiated with carbidopa/levodopa (25 mg/100 mg) three times daily, titrated up to four times daily over two weeks. Within one month of treatment, his tremor significantly improved, and rigidity and bradykinesia also became less pronounced. To address motor fluctuations that developed after three months of therapy, an adjunctive dopamine agonist, pramipexole, was added at an initial dose of 0.125 mg three times daily, titrated to 0.5 mg three times daily as tolerated. He also attended physical therapy sessions focused on gait training, balance exercises, and flexibility improvement.
At the six-month follow-up, the patient reported improved quality of life, with better management of his motor symptoms and greater ease in performing daily activities. Although mild dyskinesia was noted, it did not significantly affect his function, and medical therapy continued to be adjusted to optimize symptom control."
