48. Patient: (on raising leg) Ouch! That really hurts down my leg.  
49. Physician: Thank you for letting me know. From your symptoms and examination, I suspect a nerve in your lower spine might be compressed, possibly due to a herniated disc. I’ll arrange further tests, such as an MRI, to confirm this.  
50. Patient: A herniated disc? That sounds serious. What does that mean?  "
