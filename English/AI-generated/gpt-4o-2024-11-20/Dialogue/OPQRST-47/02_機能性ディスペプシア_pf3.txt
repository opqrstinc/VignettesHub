50. 患者：They’ve been constant for the past three months.  
51. 医師：Based on what you’ve told me and after reviewing your tests, it seems like you might have a condition called functional dyspepsia.  
52. 患者：What is that?  
53. 医師：It’s a common digestive disorder where the stomach doesn’t function smoothly, causing fullness, bloating, and sometimes discomfort. It’s not caused by an underlying disease, but rather how the stomach processes food."
