26. Patient: Yes, my writing has gotten smaller and less clear.  
27. Physician: Are there any other symptoms you’ve noticed, like memory problems or mood changes?

39. Physician: Have you been exposed to any toxins or done work with chemicals?  
40. Patient: No, nothing that I can think of.  
41. Physician: Let me ask you a bit about your daily activities. Do you feel these symptoms limit what you can do?  
42. Patient: Some things take longer, but I try to manage. My tremor is what bothers me the most.

47. Physician: A couple more questions—any dizziness or fainting spells?  
48. Patient: No, I haven’t had any of those.  
49. Physician: Alright, based on what you've described and what I’ve observed, I believe you may have a condition called Parkinson’s disease, which affects movement and commonly causes symptoms like tremor, stiffness, and slowness.  
50. Patient: Parkinson's disease? What does that mean for me?  "
