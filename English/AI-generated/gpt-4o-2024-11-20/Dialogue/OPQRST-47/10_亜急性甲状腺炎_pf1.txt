"1.  
Physician: What brings you in today?  
Patient: I've been having pain in my neck for the past two weeks, and I also have a low-grade fever.  
2.  
Physician: Could you describe the pain? Is it sharp, dull, or something else?  
Patient: It started as mild discomfort, but it's been getting worse gradually. It's a dull, aching kind of pain.  
3.  
Physician: Is the pain constant, or does it come and go?  
Patient: It's mostly constant, though it gets worse when I touch my neck or move it.  
4.  
Physician: Have you noticed any swelling in your neck?  
Patient: No, I don’t think it’s swollen, but it feels a bit tender when I press on it.  
5.  
Physician: Have you had any other symptoms along with the neck pain?  
Patient: Yes, I've been feeling very tired. I also noticed my heart sometimes beats fast, and I lost about 3 kilograms recently without trying.  
6.  
Physician: When did the fever and tiredness start?  
Patient: Around the same time as the neck pain, about two weeks ago.  
7.

Patient: No, nothing like that.  
10.

Patient: It happens a few times a day, lasts for a minute or so, then goes away.  
11.  
Physician: Do you feel shortness of breath or chest pain with the palpitations?  
Patient: No, it’s just the fast heartbeat, no pain or difficulty breathing.  
12.

13.

Patient: No, not that I know of.  
22.

Patient: No, I don’t smoke, and I only drink occasionally.  
23.  
Physician: What about your general activity level? Has it changed because of the symptoms?  
Patient: Yes. I’ve been resting more because I just feel so fatigued.  
24.  
Physician: Let’s talk more about your weight loss. Was it intentional?  
Patient: No, it wasn’t. I just noticed my clothes feel looser, and I checked my weight.  
25.  
Physician: Have you ever had thyroid issues or abnormal thyroid tests in the past?  
Patient: No, this is the first time I’ve had anything like this.  
26.  
Physician: Have you had any joint pain, rashes, or other unusual symptoms?  
Patient: No, none of that.  
27.  
Physician: Have you traveled recently or had contact with anyone who’s been ill?  
Patient: No, I’ve stayed home mostly and haven’t been around sick people.  
28.  
Physician: Do you remember the neck pain being triggered by anything specific?  
Patient: No, it just seemed to come on out of nowhere.  
29.  
Physician: Is there anything that makes the pain worse or better?  
Patient: Touching or moving my neck makes it worse, and resting helps a bit.  
30.  
Physician: You mentioned the pain is mostly in the front of your neck. Does it radiate anywhere else?  
Patient: No, it’s pretty localized to the front.  
31.  
Physician: What made you decide to come in today?  
Patient: The pain hasn’t gone away, and with the fever and weight loss, I’m getting worried.  
32.  
Physician: That’s understandable. How’s your sleep been?  
Patient: Not great, I wake up a lot during the night.  
33.  
Physician: Any specific reason you’re waking up? Is it the neck pain?  
Patient: It might be. It’s hard to get comfortable sometimes.  
34.  
Physician: Let me check your neck. Does it hurt when I press here?  
Patient: Yes, that’s really tender!  
35.  
Physician: Your thyroid feels tender on the right. Have you noticed any hoarseness in your voice?  
Patient: No, my voice has been fine.  
36.  
Physician: Are you able to turn your head normally, or is mobility restricted?  
Patient: I can turn it, but it’s a little uncomfortable.  
37.  
Physician: Thanks for telling me all this. I’d like to run some blood tests to check your thyroid function and inflammation levels.  
Patient: Sure, whatever you need to do.  
38.  
Physician: We’ll also do an ultrasound or imaging to assess your thyroid in more detail.  
Patient: Okay, that sounds good.  
39.  
Physician: Based on what you’ve told me, I’m suspecting it might be related to your thyroid.  
Patient: My thyroid? I’ve never had issues with that before.  
40.  
Physician: It could be a temporary inflammation causing these symptoms. We need the tests to confirm.  
Patient: I see. Is it something serious?  
41.  
Physician: Often, it resolves on its own, but some cases require treatment. We’ll know more soon.  
Patient: Got it. So, what happens if it needs treatment?  
42.  
Physician: Usually, we’d focus on managing the pain and inflammation.  
Patient: That makes sense.  
43.  
Physician: I’ll also check your thyroid hormone levels since they may be fluctuating.  
Patient: Okay, I’m curious what those tests will show.  
44.  
Physician: In some cases, the thyroid can release excess hormones during inflammation.  
Patient: So, that could explain my palpitations and weight loss?  
45.  
Physician: Exactly. If that’s the case, we can manage those symptoms as well.  
Patient: Alright, thanks for explaining everything.  
46.  
Physician: If the thyroid scan shows decreased activity, it’ll confirm inflammation.  
Patient: And what happens after that?  
47.  
Physician: We’d start treatment like anti-inflammatory medications or beta-blockers.  
Patient: Okay, sounds like there’s a plan.  
48.  
Physician: Yes, and we’ll monitor to make sure it resolves fully.  
Patient: That’s reassuring.  
49.  
Physician: Based on your presentation and initial findings, this likely is subacute thyroiditis.  
Patient: I’ve never heard of that.  
50.  
Physician: It’s a temporary inflammation of the thyroid, often self-limiting with proper care.  
Patient: Thank you for helping me understand!  "
