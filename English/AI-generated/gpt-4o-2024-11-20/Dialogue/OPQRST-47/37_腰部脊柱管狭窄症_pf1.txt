"1. 医師：Hello, I’m Dr. Smith. What brings you in today?  
2. 患者：Hi, Doctor. I’ve been having worsening back pain that spreads to my legs. It’s been going on for about six months.  
3. 医師：I see. Could you describe the pain? Is it sharp, dull, or something else?  
4. 患者：It’s mostly dull, but sometimes it gets sharp. It gets worse when I stand or walk for a long time.  
5. 医師：Does anything help relieve the pain?  
6. 患者：Sitting down or leaning forward helps.  
7. 医師：Do you feel this pain more in one leg or both?  
8. 患者：It affects both legs about the same.  
9. 医師：Are there any other symptoms, like numbness or weakness?  
10. 患者：Yes, my legs feel numb sometimes, and they also feel weak when I walk too far.  
11. 医師：How far can you walk before the pain and numbness start?  
12. 患者：Not very far—maybe about 100 meters. After that, I have to stop.  
13. 医師：I understand. Have these symptoms limited your daily activities?  
14. 患者：Yes, it’s been harder to do simple things. Even grocery shopping is difficult.  
15. 医師：Have you noticed any bowel or bladder problems?  
16. 患者：No, nothing like that.  
17. 医師：Have you experienced any fever, weight loss, or night sweats?  
18. 患者：No, I haven’t.  
19. 医師：Do you have any history of back problems?  
20. 患者：Yes, 15 years ago, I was told I had a herniated disc.  
21. 医師：How was that managed back then?  
22. 患者：I did physical therapy, and it got better over time.  
23. 医師：Any injuries or accidents recently?  
24. 患者：No, nothing like that.  
25. 医師：Do you take any medications for your symptoms now?  
26. 患者：Just over-the-counter painkillers like ibuprofen sometimes.  
27. 医師：Have you noticed any changes in the way your legs look, like swelling or muscle loss?  
28. 患者：No, they look the same to me.  
29. 医師：When you feel the numbness, where exactly do you notice it?  
30. 患者：Mostly on the sides of my lower legs and feet.  
31. 医師：Does the numbness or weakness affect your balance?  
32. 患者：A little bit, yes. I sometimes feel unsteady.  
33. 医師：Do you find climbing stairs or standing up difficult?  
34. 患者：Yes, my legs feel weak when I climb stairs.  
35. 医師：You mentioned the pain worsens with standing. Does it also worsen when bending backward?  
36. 患者：Yes, it does.  
37. 医師：I’d like to understand more about your daily activities. What’s your routine like?  
38. 患者：I used to take walks and stay pretty active, but now I avoid walking because of the pain.  
39. 医師：Do you feel this has affected your mood or sleep?  
40. 患者：Yes, it’s frustrating, and I don’t sleep as well because I wake up from the discomfort.  
41. 医師：You mentioned the pain improves when leaning forward. Is this consistent?  
42. 患者：Yes, leaning forward or sitting down always makes it better.  
43. 医師：Do you have any family history of back problems?  
44. 患者：Not that I know of.  
45. 医師：Do you have any conditions like diabetes or other chronic illnesses?  
46. 患者：No, I don’t.  
47. 医師：Alright, based on what you’ve told me and my examination findings, you might have lumbar spinal stenosis, particularly at the L4-L5 level.  
48. 患者：What exactly is lumbar spinal stenosis?  
49. 医師：It’s a narrowing of the spinal canal that can compress the nerves in your lower back, causing the symptoms you’ve described.  
50. 患者：I see. What can be done about it?
