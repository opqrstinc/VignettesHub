"1. 医師：Hi, thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me more about the pain you're experiencing?  
2. 患者：Sure, it's a sharp, stabbing pain on the left side of my face, mostly around my cheek and jaw.  
3. 医師：When did this pain start?  
4. 患者：It started about two months ago.  
5. 医師：How often do you experience this pain?  
6. 患者：It happens several times a day.  
7. 医師：How would you describe the severity of the pain?  
8. 患者：It's very severe—it feels like electric shocks.  
9. 医師：How long do the episodes of pain usually last?  
10. 患者：Usually just a few seconds to a couple of minutes.  
11. 医師：Is there anything that seems to trigger the pain?  
12. 患者：Yes, simple things like brushing my teeth, chewing, or even touching my face.  
13. 医師：Do you notice any numbness or weakness in your face along with the pain?  
14. 患者：No, none at all.  
15. 医師：Have you ever had any similar episodes in the past?  
16. 患者：No, this is the first time I've experienced anything like this.  
17. 医師：Have you had any recent trauma to your face or head?  
18. 患者：No, nothing like that.  
19. 医師：Any recent infections, fevers, or weight loss?  
20. 患者：No, not that I can think of.  
21. 医師：Do you have any other medical conditions or a history of surgery?  
22. 患者：No, I'm generally healthy.  
23. 医師：Do you notice the pain worsening at specific times of the day or in certain environments?  
24. 患者：Not really, it just happens throughout the day.  
25. 医師：How has this pain been affecting your daily activities?  
26. 患者：It's quite disruptive. I'm afraid to do simple things like eating or smiling.  
27. 医師：That sounds very difficult to manage. Has this caused you any stress or anxiety?  
28. 患者：Yes, I feel anxious all the time, waiting for the pain to come back.  
29. 医師：Do painkillers, like over-the-counter medications, provide any relief?  
30. 患者：No, they haven’t helped at all.  
31. 医師：Has anyone in your family had similar symptoms or conditions?  
32. 患者：No, this seems to just be me.  
33. 医師：Let me briefly examine your face. Does this hurt when I lightly touch this part?  
34. 患者：Yes, that’s exactly where the pain happens!  
35. 医師：Alright, I’ll also check your neurological function. Do you feel me touching here?  
36. 患者：Yes, I can feel it perfectly fine, no numbness at all.  
37. 医師：Good, and can you clench your jaw for me?  
38. 患者：Sure.  
39. 医師：Any pain or difficulty moving your jaw when you do that?  
40. 患者：No, just the normal motion—no pain with that.  
41. 医師：Have you noticed any swelling or redness on your face?  
42. 患者：No, nothing like that.  
43. 医師：We performed an MRI scan to rule out any structural issues. It showed a blood vessel pressing on the nerve in your face.  
44. 患者：Oh, so that’s causing the pain?  
45. 医師：Yes, it appears to be causing irritation of your trigeminal nerve, leading to your symptoms.  
46. 患者：What does that mean?  
47. 医師：This condition is called trigeminal neuralgia. It’s caused by irritation or compression of the trigeminal nerve, which controls sensation in your face.  
48. 患者：Is it treatable?  
49. 医師：Yes, most people respond well to medication. We'll start with a drug called carbamazepine.  
50. 患者：Okay, will that stop the pain completely?  
51. 医師：It often helps significantly. We’ll start at a low dose and adjust as needed to control the pain."
