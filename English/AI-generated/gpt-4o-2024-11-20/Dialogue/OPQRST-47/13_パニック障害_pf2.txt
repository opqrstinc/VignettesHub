"1. 医師：Hello, I understand you’ve been experiencing some distressing symptoms. Can you tell me what brought you in today?  
2. 患者：I’ve been having episodes where I suddenly can’t catch my breath, and my chest feels tight and painful.  
3. 医師：When did these symptoms first start, and how often have they been occurring?  
4. 患者：They started about six months ago, but they’ve been happening more often recently, maybe a few times a week now.  
5. 医師：What was the most recent episode like? Can you describe it in detail?  
6. 患者：It happened at work. Out of nowhere, I felt like I couldn’t breathe, my chest hurt, my stomach cramped, and I thought something terrible was about to happen.  
7. 医師：How long did this recent episode last?  
8. 患者：Maybe 20 minutes, but it felt much longer at the time.  
9. 医師：The sense of something terrible about to happen—was that a strong feeling during the episode?  
10. 患者：Yes, I felt completely panicked, like I was about to die or something awful was going to happen.  
11. 医師：What about the chest pain—can you describe it?  
12. 患者：It’s sharp, right in the center of my chest, but it doesn’t spread anywhere else.  
13. 医師：And the abdominal discomfort? Can you tell me more about that?  
14. 患者：It’s like a cramping pain, but I can’t really pinpoint exactly where it’s coming from.  
15. 医師：Have you noticed any specific triggers for these episodes, like physical activity or certain foods?  
16. 患者：I’m not sure. They happen randomly, though they seem to occur more when I’m stressed.  
17. 医師：Have you seen any other doctors for these symptoms?  
18. 患者：Yes, I went to the ER twice in the last few months, but they couldn’t find anything wrong.  
19. 医師：Did they do any tests at the ER?  
20. 患者：Yes, they ran a bunch of tests, like heart and stomach checks, but they said everything was normal.  
21. 医師：How is your overall health otherwise? Any other medical conditions?  
22. 患者：I was diagnosed with depression a while ago and used to take medication for it, but I stopped about a year ago.  
23. 医師：What medication were you taking for depression?  
24. 患者：It was called sertraline, 50 mg a day.  
25. 医師：Why did you stop taking it?  
26. 患者：I just felt better at the time and thought I didn’t need it anymore.  
27. 医師：Since stopping the medication, have you noticed any changes in your mood or energy levels?  
28. 患者：I’ve been more anxious, especially with these episodes happening.  
29. 医師：Have you ever experienced similar episodes before these last six months?  
30. 患者：No, nothing like this before.  
31. 医師：Are there any specific times or situations where you feel more at risk of these episodes happening?  
32. 患者：Mostly when I’m at work or thinking about stressful things.  
33. 医師：What do you do to try to relieve the symptoms when they happen?  
34. 患者：I sit down, try to take deep breaths, but it’s hard because it feels like I’m suffocating.  
35. 医師：Do you ever feel dizzy or lightheaded during these episodes?  
36. 患者：Sometimes, yes.  
37. 医師：Have you noticed sweating or shaking during these attacks?  
38. 患者：Yes, I sweat a lot and my hands shake.  
39. 医師：Do you have any family history of anxiety, depression, or other mental health issues?  
40. 患者：My mom has anxiety, and my brother used to see a therapist for depression.  
41. 医師：What about heart disease or gastrointestinal issues in the family?  
42. 患者：No, nothing like that in my family.  
43. 医師：Are you currently taking any medications or supplements?  
44. 患者：No, nothing right now.  
45. 医師：Have you been to therapy or counseling for your anxiety or depression before?  
46. 患者：I did some therapy a few years ago, but not recently.  
47. 医師：When you think back over the past few months, how much of your life have these episodes disrupted?  
48. 患者：A lot. It’s hard to focus at work, and I feel scared to go out sometimes, worrying it might happen again.  
49. 医師：Based on what you’ve described, I believe your symptoms are consistent with a condition called panic disorder. It’s caused by recurrent panic attacks like the ones you’ve been experiencing.  
50. 患者：Panic disorder? That makes sense now... I thought something was seriously wrong with my heart or stomach."
