"1. 医師：What brings you to the clinic today?  
2. 患者：I've been having palpitations and hand tremors, and they’ve been getting worse over the past three months.  
3. 医師：I see. Could you describe these tremors a bit more? Are they constant or do they come and go?  
4. 患者：They’re mostly constant, and they get worse when my hands are outstretched.  
5. 医師：What about the palpitations? How often do you feel them?  
6. 患者：I feel them almost every day, especially when I’m at rest or lying down.  
7. 医師：Have you noticed anything else, like sweating or feeling unusually warm?  
8. 患者：Yes, I’ve been sweating a lot and can’t tolerate heat like I used to.  
9. 医師：Have you experienced any changes in your weight recently?  
10. 患者：Yes, I’ve lost about 8 kilograms in the past three months, but I haven’t been dieting, and my appetite is fine.  
11. 医師：How about sleep? Are you sleeping well?  
12. 患者：Not really. I often feel restless and have a hard time falling asleep.  
13. 医師：How’s your mood been lately? Any irritability or fatigue?  
14. 患者：I’ve been feeling very irritable, and I get tired easily.  
15. 医師：Do you or any of your family members have a history of thyroid problems or similar conditions?  
16. 患者：No, not that I’m aware of.  
17. 医師：Have you been sick recently or started any new medications?  
18. 患者：No, I haven’t been sick, and I’m not taking any medications.  
19. 医師：Have you consumed any substances like caffeine or drugs that might be causing these symptoms?  
20. 患者：No, I don’t drink much caffeine, and I don’t use any drugs.  
21. 医師：When did you first notice these symptoms?  
22. 患者：It started about three months ago, and it’s been gradually getting worse.  
23. 医師：How’s your appetite and digestion? Any nausea, diarrhea, or other issues?  
24. 患者：My appetite’s fine, no nausea or digestion problems.  
25. 医師：Have you noticed any changes in your eyes, like bulging or discomfort?  
26. 患者：Now that you mention it, my eyes have felt a little puffy, and people say they look different.  
27. 医師：Do you have any neck discomfort or trouble swallowing?  
28. 患者：No, my neck feels fine, and I have no trouble swallowing.  
29. 医師：What about skin changes, like unusual dryness, swelling, or a rash?  
30. 患者：No, my skin seems normal.  
31. 医師：I’ll examine your neck and hands now. Please let me know if you feel any pain.  
32. 患者：Sure.  
33. 医師：Your thyroid feels a bit enlarged but not tender. I also notice some tremors when your hands are outstretched.  
34. 患者：Is that concerning?  
35. 医師：It could point to an overactive thyroid gland. Have you felt any muscle weakness or had trouble with fine motor skills?  
36. 患者：I haven’t noticed much, but I do feel a bit weaker than usual.  
37. 医師：How about chest pain or difficulty breathing?  
38. 患者：Sometimes my heart feels like it’s racing, but no chest pain or breathing issues.  
39. 医師：Have there been any changes in your menstrual cycle?  
40. 患者：It’s been a little irregular lately.  
41. 医師：Now I’ll check your vital signs. Your heart rate is 120, and your blood pressure is slightly high at 142 over 88. Have you noticed your heart racing?  
42. 患者：Yes, that’s one of the main reasons I came in.  
43. 医師：I also noticed mild proptosis and lid lag when examining your eyes. Have you noticed difficulty moving them?  
44. 患者：No, I don’t think so.  
45. 医師：Your reflexes are quite brisk, which fits with what you’ve described. We’ll need some blood tests and a thyroid scan to confirm what’s going on.  
46. 患者：Okay, is this serious?  
47. 医師：It’s likely a thyroid issue, like hyperthyroidism, which we’ll confirm. We’ll also check your thyroid hormone levels and antibodies.  
48. 患者：I see. What could be causing it?  
49. 医師：Your symptoms suggest Graves’ disease, but we need the tests to confirm. It’s a condition where the thyroid produces too much hormone.  
50. 患者：I’m glad we’re looking into it. Thank you, doctor.  
51. 医師：Once we confirm the diagnosis, we’ll start treatment. I’ll see you after the test results come in.
