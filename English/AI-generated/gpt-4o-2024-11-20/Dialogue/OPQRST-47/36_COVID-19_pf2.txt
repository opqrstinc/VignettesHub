Physician: Hello, I’m Dr. Smith. What brings you in today?  
Patient: Hi, I’ve been feeling really sick for the past few days.  
2.  
Physician: Can you tell me more about your symptoms?  
Patient: I’ve had a fever for three days, I feel really tired, and it’s hard to breathe at times.  
3.  
Physician: What’s the highest temperature you’ve recorded with the fever?  
Patient: It went up to around 39.2°C, I think it’s about 102.5°F.  
4.  
Physician: Is the fever constant, or does it come and go?  
Patient: It comes and goes, but when it’s there, it feels really bad.  
5.  
Physician: Have you noticed any other symptoms?  
Patient: Yeah, I suddenly lost my sense of taste two days ago, and I can't smell anything either.  
6.  
Physician: That sounds uncomfortable. Did anything specific trigger the symptoms, or was it abrupt?  
Patient: It just started out of nowhere.  
7.  
Physician: How has your breathing been?  
Patient: It’s been getting worse over the last day. I feel out of breath just doing small things.  
8.

Patient: I’ve had some chills and a bit of muscle soreness, but I wouldn’t say it’s too bad.  
12.

Patient: The breathing and how tired I feel.  
22.

Physician: When did you first notice the loss of taste and smell?  
Patient: It started on the second day after the fever began.  
24.

Patient: No, I haven’t noticed anything like that.  
32.  
Physician: Out of everything, what concerns you the most about how you feel?  
Patient: It’s the breathing, because I don’t know why it’s getting worse.  
33.  
Physician: Have you experienced anything like this before?  
Patient: No, this is the first time I’ve felt this way.  
34.

Patient: No, deep breaths don’t hurt.

Patient: My sister goes to work, but my parents mostly stay home.  
44.

Patient: Not at all, my breathing just feels heavy.  
47.  
Physician: Do you wear a mask when you go out?  
Patient: Yes, I always wear one.  
48.  
Physician: Given your close contact with a COVID-19 patient, I’d like to run some tests, including a COVID swab.  
Patient: Okay, that makes sense.  
49.  
Physician: We’ll also check your oxygen levels and do some imaging of your chest to rule out other issues.  
Patient: Alright, I just hope this isn’t something serious.  
50.  
Physician: Based on your symptoms, close contact, and test results, you have a mild-to-moderate case of COVID-19 pneumonia.  
Patient: Oh, I was afraid it might be something like that. What now?  "
