6. Patient: Yes, I have a mild cough, but it’s dry. Also, I’ve had a fever.

8. Patient: Three days ago, at the same time the shortness of breath started.

28. Patient: No, none of that.  
29. Doctor: Are you experiencing any trouble swallowing or changes in your voice?  
30. Patient: No, my throat is fine.  
31. Doctor: Do you feel tired or weak more than usual?  
32. Patient: A little, but I think it’s because of the fever and breathing.  
33. Doctor: Have you lost weight recently without trying?

40. Patient: It started gradually three days ago and has been getting worse since.  
41. Doctor: Do you feel anxious or stressed about anything right now?  
42. Patient: I’m mostly worried about my breathing. It’s scary to feel like this.  
43. Doctor: Have you noticed any changes in your appetite?  
44. Patient: Not really, but eating makes me feel a bit breathless.  
45. Doctor: How well are you sleeping?  
46. Patient: Not great. I wake up a lot because I feel like I can’t breathe.  
47. Doctor: Have you had any blood in your sputum when you cough?  
48. Patient: No, there’s no blood, just the dry cough.  
49. Doctor: Were you in your usual health before these symptoms began?  
50. Patient: Yes, I was completely fine, besides starting smoking recently.  
51. Doctor: Based on your symptoms and evaluation, it seems that your recent smoking may have contributed to your current condition. I'll conduct some tests like a chest X-ray and blood work to confirm what’s going on. Your symptoms and findings point toward acute eosinophilic pneumonia, which can happen after starting smoking.
