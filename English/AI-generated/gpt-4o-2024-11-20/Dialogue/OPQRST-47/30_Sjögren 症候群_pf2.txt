3. Physician: Can you tell me more about the dry mouth?  
4. Patient: My mouth always feels parched, even after drinking water. Eating dry foods has become difficult.  
5. Physician: Do you find yourself needing to drink water frequently?  
6. Patient: Yes, I take sips of water constantly throughout the day.  
7. Physician: Have you noticed any other symptoms, like throat irritation or difficulty swallowing?  
8. Patient: Yes, swallowing feels harder, especially with dry foods like bread.  
9. Physician: You mentioned fatigue earlier. Can you describe it more?  
10. Patient: I feel worn out almost all the time, even when I haven't done much. No amount of rest seems to help.  
11. Physician: Any joint issues?  
12. Patient: Yes, I've been having pain and stiffness, mostly in my knees, elbows, and the small joints of my hands.  
13. Physician: Does the joint pain move around, or is it consistent?

16. Patient: Sometimes they swell a little, but they’re never red.  
17. Physician: Have you dealt with any vision problems or eye discomfort?

19. Physician: Are the eye symptoms consistent or do they come and go?  
20. Patient: They tend to come and go, but they’ve been more frequent lately.  
21. Physician: How about other symptoms, like fever, weight loss, or recent infections?

24. Patient: No, I’ve never been diagnosed with anything like that.  
25. Physician: Does anyone in your family have autoimmune conditions?  
26. Patient: No, my family history is pretty unremarkable in that regard.  
27. Physician: How's your overall oral health? Any issues with cavities or gum problems?  
28. Patient: I get cavities more often now, despite brushing and flossing.

30. Patient: I’ve noticed some swelling, but it doesn’t hurt.

45. Physician: Have you tried anything to improve the symptoms?  
46. Patient: Besides staying hydrated and using eye drops, not really.  
47. Physician: After examining you, I noticed your oral mucosa is quite dry and your salivary glands are a bit enlarged.  
48. Patient: That makes sense—it feels like there’s no moisture at all.  
49. Physician: Your joint symptoms and eye problems, combined with your lab findings and biopsy, suggest a condition called primary Sjögren syndrome.  
50. Patient: Sjögren syndrome? I’ve never heard of it. What does that mean?  "
