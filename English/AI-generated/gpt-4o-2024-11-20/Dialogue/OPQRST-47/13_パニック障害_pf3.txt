3. 医師: How long has this been going on?  
4. 患者: It started about three months ago, and it keeps happening.  
5. 医師: Can you describe what happens during these episodes?  
6. 患者: My heart starts pounding suddenly, I feel like I can't breathe, and sometimes there's pain or pressure in my chest.  
7. 医師: How long do these episodes usually last?  
8. 患者: Around 10 or 15 minutes, then it slowly gets better.  
9. 医師: Is there anything that seems to trigger them?  
10. 患者: Not really, they just happen out of nowhere.  
11. 医師: How often do you get these episodes?

14. 患者: Yes, I feel like I might faint sometimes.  
15. 医師: Have you ever actually passed out?  
16. 患者: No, I've never fainted, but it feels close.  
17. 医師: Any feelings of nausea or other symptoms?  
18. 患者: Yeah, I sometimes feel nauseous, and I also get this overwhelming fear, like something terrible is going to happen.

20. 患者: Definitely, I’m constantly afraid of it happening again, especially in public.  
21. 医師: Has this affected your daily life or routine?  
22. 患者: Absolutely, I avoid crowded places and social events because I'm scared it’ll happen.  
23. 医師: Have you had any chest pain outside of these episodes?  
24. 患者: No, not at all.  
25. 医師: How about fever, weight changes, or breathing issues like coughing?

33. 医師: Does anyone in your family have similar symptoms or a history of heart problems?  
34. 患者: No, my family is healthy.  
35. 医師: Have you noticed anything else that might be connected to these episodes, like difficulty sleeping or mood changes?

41. 医師: Was there a particular reason you waited this long to seek help?  
42. 患者: I wasn’t sure if it was serious enough, but it’s gotten worse over time.  
43. 医師: I understand. Did you notice these episodes happening more in any specific situation, like at work or after exercise?  
44. 患者: Not really, they can happen anywhere, even when I’m just relaxing at home.  
45. 医師: Have you had your thyroid checked before, or any bloodwork done?  
46. 患者: Not recently, but I think everything was normal the last time I had a check-up.  
47. 医師: All right, I’d like to ask a few more questions. Have you recently felt afraid of losing control or going crazy during these episodes?  
48. 患者: Yes, I feel like I’m about to completely lose it.  
49. 医師: Thank you for sharing that. Based on what you’ve described, we can explore what might be causing these symptoms.  
50. 患者: Is it something serious, like my heart or lungs?  
51. 医師: Based on your symptoms and the tests we've done, this does not seem to be a heart or lung issue. It fits more with something called panic disorder."
