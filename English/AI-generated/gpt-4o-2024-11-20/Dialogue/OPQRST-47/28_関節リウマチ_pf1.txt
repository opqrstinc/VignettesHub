46. 患者: No, this is the first time I’m seeing a doctor about it.  
47. 医師: Based on what you're describing, I’ll need to examine your joints and check for tenderness and swelling.  
48. 患者: Sure, that’s fine.  
49. 医師: After examining your joints and reviewing your lab results, I believe we have enough information.  
50. 患者: Do you know what’s causing this?  
51. 医師: It looks like you have rheumatoid arthritis, a condition that causes joint inflammation and pain.
