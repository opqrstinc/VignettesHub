"1. Physician: What brings you in today?  
2. Patient: I've been having this burning sensation from my throat down to my chest for a while now.

4. Patient: It's been on and off for about three months, but it's been getting worse over the past two weeks.  
5. Physician: Can you describe the burning sensation? When does it usually happen?  
6. Patient: It happens mostly after I eat, especially big meals or spicy food. It's worse when I lie down.  
7. Physician: Does anything else trigger this feeling?  
8. Patient: Not that I can think of, but eating late at night sometimes makes it worse.  
9. Physician: Have you noticed any other symptoms, like nausea or vomiting?  
10. Patient: I've felt mildly nauseous occasionally, but no vomiting.  
11. Physician: Do you experience regurgitation, like acid or food coming back up into your throat?

13. Physician: Does the discomfort ever wake you up at night?  
14. Patient: Yes, it has woken me up a few times lately.  
15. Physician: Have you noticed any unintentional weight loss, blood in your vomit, or black, tarry stools?  
16. Patient: No, none of that. My weight's been stable.  
17. Physician: Do you have a history of similar issues in the past?  
18. Patient: I had a stomach ulcer years ago, but it was treated with medication, and I haven't had problems since until now.  
19. Physician: Do you take any medications currently?  
20. Patient: Yes, atorvastatin for my cholesterol.  
21. Physician: How about over-the-counter medications or supplements?  
22. Patient: Not regularly, but I occasionally take antacids when my symptoms are bad.  
23. Physician: Do you smoke or drink alcohol?  
24. Patient: No, I don't smoke, and I only drink on special occasions.  
25. Physician: How is your diet? Do you eat a lot of fatty or spicy foods?  
26. Patient: I do enjoy spicy food and fried things, but I try not to overdo it.  
27. Physician: Does the burning sensation happen during exercise or physical activity?  
28. Patient: No, it seems unrelated to that.  
29. Physician: Have there been any recent changes in your lifestyle or stress levels?  
30. Patient: Not really, my routine's been the same.  
31. Physician: Do you notice relief with any specific remedies, like the antacids you mentioned?  
32. Patient: Yes, those help for a little while, but the symptoms come back.  
33. Physician: Have you ever had an endoscopy or other stomach examinations in the past?  
34. Patient: I had an endoscopy when I was diagnosed with the ulcer, but that was a long time ago.  
35. Physician: Have you had any fever, chills, or other symptoms lately?

42. Patient: It has its ups and downs, but itâ€™s definitely worse now than before.  
43. Physician: Do you drink a lot of caffeinated beverages like coffee or tea?  
44. Patient: I do drink coffee every morning, but only a cup or two.  
45. Physician: Have you tried changing your diet or eating habits to see if that helps?  
46. Patient: Not really, I haven't thought much about that.  
47. Physician: When you lie down and feel the burning, does elevating your head help?  
48. Patient: I haven't tried that, but maybe I should?  
49. Physician: Has this affected your daily life or sleep significantly?  
50. Patient: A little bit. It's just frustrating more than anything else.  
51. Physician: Based on your symptoms, history, and our findings, it looks like you have GERD, or gastroesophageal reflux disease. This is caused by stomach acid irritating your esophagus.  
52. Patient: That makes sense with the burning and the acid coming up. What can we do about it? "
