"1. 医師：Good morning, sir. What brings you to the clinic today?  
2. 患者：Good morning, doctor. I've been feeling this spinning sensation when I move my head, especially in the morning.  
3. 医師：How long have you been experiencing this spinning sensation?  
4. 患者：It started about two days ago and has been happening on and off since then.  
5. 医師：Can you describe the spinning sensation in more detail? How does it feel?  
6. 患者：It feels like the whole room is spinning around me. It lasts less than a minute, but it’s very unsettling.  
7. 医師：Does it happen every time you move your head in a certain direction?  
8. 患者：Yes, particularly when I get out of bed or look up quickly.  
9. 医師：Have you noticed any hearing loss, ringing in the ears, or ear pain accompanying the dizziness?  
10. 患者：No, none of those. My ears feel fine.  
11. 医師：What about vision problems like double vision or trouble focusing?  
12. 患者：No, I haven’t had any issues with my vision.  
13. 医師：Have you experienced any difficulty speaking, swallowing, or weakness in your arms or legs?  
14. 患者：No, not at all. Everything feels normal except for the vertigo.  
15. 医師：Have you ever fainted or felt like you were going to pass out?  
16. 患者：No, I’ve never lost consciousness.  
17. 医師：Do you have any medical conditions I should know about?  
18. 患者：Yes, I have high blood pressure and diabetes, but they’re under control with medication.  
19. 医師：Have you started any new medications recently, or have you had any recent illnesses or injuries?  
20. 患者：No new medications, and I haven’t been sick or injured lately.  
21. 医師：Do you remember if anything triggered the first episode of vertigo?  
22. 患者：Not exactly, but it happened after I got out of bed in the morning.  
23. 医師：Have you noticed that your symptoms are worse at any particular time of day?  
24. 患者：Yes, mornings are the worst, especially when I try to get up.  
25. 医師：Does anything make the spinning sensation go away or make it worse?  
26. 患者：It usually stops if I stay still, but moving my head makes it worse.  
27. 医師：Have you experienced anything like this before?  
28. 患者：No, this is the first time this has ever happened.  
29. 医師：How is this affecting your daily life?  
30. 患者：It’s making it hard to get out of bed and start my day, but once I’m upright and careful, I can manage.  
31. 医師：Do you feel anxious or stressed about these episodes?  
32. 患者：A little, yes. It’s scary when it happens, but I’m managing.  
33. 医師：Do you live alone, or do you have someone at home to help if needed?  
34. 患者：I live with my wife, and she’s been supportive.  
35. 医師：Thank you. I’d like to do a physical exam now to understand your symptoms better. May I proceed?  
36. 患者：Of course, go ahead.  
37. 医師：I’m going to check your eyes and perform a test called the Dix-Hallpike maneuver. You might feel some spinning during this. Is that okay?  
38. 患者：Sure, doctor. Let’s do it.  
39. 医師：I’ll start by turning your head to the right and quickly lowering you backwards. Try to relax.  
40. 患者：Alright, I’m ready.  
(The Dix-Hallpike maneuver is performed, and vertigo is reproduced with nystagmus.)  
41. 医師：It looks like the spinning sensation is triggered with this maneuver, and I see nystagmus in your eyes. How are you feeling now?  
42. 患者：It’s a little unsettling, but I’m okay.  
43. 医師：This result is consistent with a condition called benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, or BPPV. It’s caused by tiny crystals in your inner ear shifting out of place.  
44. 患者：BPPV? I’ve never heard of that. Is it serious?  
45. 医師：It’s not serious or life-threatening, and it’s usually fixable with proper maneuvers. Would you like me to explain the next steps?  
46. 患者：Yes, please.  
47. 医師：I’ll perform a procedure called the Epley maneuver right now. It helps reposition the crystals in your inner ear.  
48. 患者：Okay, let’s do it.  
49. 医師：Great, just follow my instructions as I help guide your head through the positions.  
50. 患者：Alright, I trust you, doctor.  
(The Epley maneuver is performed successfully.)  
51. 医師：That’s it. How do you feel now?  
52. 患者：Actually, I feel much better! The spinning seems to be gone.  
53. 医師：That’s excellent. It can take some time for full recovery, so avoid quick head movements for now.  
54. 患者：Thank you so much, doctor. I’ll be careful.  
55. 医師：You’re welcome. If the symptoms return, we can repeat the maneuver. Take care!
