30. Patient: No, I haven’t.  
31. Physician: How has this been affecting your daily life?

45. Physician: Have you had routine bloodwork done in the past?  
46. Patient: No, I’ve never had blood tests done before.  
47. Physician: Based on your symptoms and history, I suspect your fatigue and other symptoms might be related to anemia. We’ll need to confirm this with bloodwork.  
48. Patient: Anemia? Is that something serious?  
49. Physician: It can vary in severity, but it’s a condition where your blood doesn’t have enough healthy red blood cells. Your symptoms fit this possibility.  
50. Patient: I see. What can cause anemia?  
51. Physician: There are several causes, but in your case, your heavy menstrual periods might be a significant factor.  
52. Patient: That makes sense because my periods are really heavy.  
53. Physician: Your lab results confirm you have iron deficiency anemia, likely due to chronic blood loss from heavy periods.  
54. Patient: Oh, I see. So, how do we treat this?  
55. Physician: We’ll start by treating the iron deficiency with iron supplements and work on managing your periods with a gynecologist.  
56. Patient: Thank you. I’m ready to start whatever I need to feel better."
