45. Doctor: On physical examination, your skin is fairly dry, and I can feel that your thyroid seems slightly enlarged. I'll take a closer look with some tests.  
46. Patient: Is it something serious?  
47. Doctor: Let’s first run some blood tests to understand your thyroid function and look for possible causes of your symptoms.  
48. Patient: Okay, thank you for explaining. What tests will you do?  
49. Doctor: I’ll check your TSH, free T4, and for any autoantibodies present. Depending on the results, we might need an ultrasound of your thyroid.  
50. Patient: All right, I hope this helps figure out what's going on.  
51. Doctor: After reviewing your test results, it seems you have primary hypothyroidism, likely caused by an autoimmune condition called Hashimoto’s thyroiditis.  
52. Patient: What does that mean?  
53. Doctor: It means your immune system is attacking your thyroid, causing it to not produce enough hormones. These hormones regulate energy, metabolism, and other bodily functions, which explains your symptoms.  
54. Patient: Is it treatable?  
55. Doctor: Yes, we can manage it with a thyroid hormone replacement called levothyroxine. It will help balance your hormone levels and improve your symptoms."
