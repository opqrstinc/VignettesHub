"1.  
Physician: Hello, I’m Dr. [Your Name]. What brings you here today?  
2.  
Patient: I’ve been having trouble breathing, especially at night and when I’m playing soccer.  
3.  
Physician: I see. Can you describe your breathing trouble?  
4.  
Patient: It feels like I can’t get enough air, and I hear a wheezing sound when I breathe.  
5.  
Physician: How long has this been happening?  
6.  
Patient: For about three weeks now.  
7.  
Physician: Is the wheezing accompanied by a cough?  
8.  
Patient: Yes, I’ve had a dry cough that just doesn’t go away.  
9.  
Physician: Does anything seem to trigger the breathing difficulty or the cough?  
10.  
Patient: Dust or cold air makes it worse.  
11.  
Physician: Are these symptoms worse during any particular time of day?  
12.  
Patient: Yes, it’s much worse at night.  
13.  
Physician: And you said it’s worse when you’re playing soccer?  
14.  
Patient: Yeah, running around during soccer practice makes it hard for me to breathe.  
15.  
Physician: Have you had any fevers, recent colds, or upper respiratory infections?  
16.  
Patient: No, I haven’t been sick recently.  
17.  
Physician: Have you ever experienced something like this before?  
18.  
Patient: No, this is the first time.  
19.  
Physician: Do you have any other medical conditions?  
20.  
Patient: I had eczema when I was little, but I think it’s gone now.  
21.  
Physician: Your mother mentioned before that you have some skin patches. Could they be from your old eczema?  
22.  
Patient's Mother: Yes, the doctor said it was atopic dermatitis when he was just a baby.  
23.  
Physician: Thank you. Do you have any known allergies?  
24.  
Patient: Not really, but I sneeze a lot when there’s dust around.  
25.  
Physician: Is there any family history of asthma or breathing problems?  
26.  
Patient: My dad has hay fever, but that’s it.  
27.  
Physician: Have you or anyone in your household been exposed to cigarette smoke?  
28.  
Patient: No, nobody smokes at home.  
29.  
Physician: When you have difficulty breathing, do you feel any chest pain or tightness?  
30.  
Patient: Sometimes it feels tight, but it doesn’t hurt.  
31.  
Physician: Have you noticed if certain seasons make it worse?  
32.  
Patient: Not really, it’s just been bad for the past three weeks.  
33.  
Physician: Have you ever used a rescue inhaler or asthma medication before?  
34.  
Patient: No, I haven’t used anything for this.  
35.  
Physician: Do you ever wake up gasping for air?  
36.  
Patient: Yes, I wake up coughing and feeling like I can’t breathe.  
37.  
Physician: Thank you. Have you noticed any changes in your stamina during physical activities?  
38.  
Patient: Definitely. I’m out of breath way quicker than usual, and I can’t keep up on the field.  
39.  
Physician: Let’s talk about your day-to-day life. Has this been affecting your school or social activities?  
40.  
Patient: It’s harder to focus in class because I’m so tired from waking up at night.  
41.  
Physician: I’m sorry to hear that. Let me ask about some other symptoms. Have you had any fevers?  
42.  
Patient: No fevers.  
43.  
Physician: Any swelling in your legs or feet?  
44.  
Patient: No, nothing like that.  
45.  
Physician: Any nausea, vomiting, or weight loss?  
46.  
Patient: Nope, I feel fine otherwise.  
47.  
Physician: Let’s focus on your breathing. When you wheeze, is it during exhaling, inhaling, or both?  
48.  
Patient: I think it’s mostly when I’m breathing out.  
49.  
Physician: Thank you for sharing all of this. Based on everything you’ve told me and the tests we’ve done, it looks like you have moderate persistent asthma.  
50.  
Patient: Oh, wow. What does that mean?  "
