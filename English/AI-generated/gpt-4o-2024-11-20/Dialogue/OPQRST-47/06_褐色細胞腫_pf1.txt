"1. 医師：Hello, I understand you're here today because you've been experiencing some episodes of palpitations and other symptoms. Can you tell me more about what's been going on?
2. 患者：Yes, for about eight months now, I've been having these episodes where my heart races, I get really sweaty, and I feel like I have this intense headache.
3. 医師：How often do these episodes occur, and how long do they usually last?
4. 患者：They happen three or four times a week, and they last about 20 or 30 minutes each time.
5. 医師：Do you notice anything that seems to trigger these episodes?
6. 患者：Not really. They just come out of nowhere. Sometimes I feel a bit anxious when they happen, though.
7. 医師：Have you noticed any other symptoms, like chest pain, dizziness, or fainting?
8. 患者：No, I don't get chest pain or fainting. Sometimes I feel a little lightheaded, but that's it.
9. 医師：You mentioned anxiety during these episodes. Do you have a history of anxiety or panic attacks?
10. 患者：No, I've never been diagnosed with anything like that before.
11. 医師：How about your blood pressure? Have you ever been told that you have high blood pressure?
12. 患者：Yes, I’ve had high blood pressure. The last time it was checked, it was around 160 over 100.
13. 医師：Have you been taking any medications for your blood pressure?
14. 患者：No, I haven’t started any medications yet.
15. 医師：Understood. Have you experienced any weight loss, fever, or changes in appetite?
16. 患者：No, my weight’s been stable, and I eat normally.
17. 医師：Do you have any family members with high blood pressure or similar symptoms?
18. 患者：No, not that I know of.
19. 医師：Have you noticed any changes in your skin, like darkening or unusual marks?
20. 患者：No, my skin seems normal to me.
21. 医師：How about your energy levels—do you feel more tired than usual?
22. 患者：No, my energy feels about the same as it always has.
23. 医師：Okay, and do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
24. 患者：I don’t smoke or use drugs, and I drink socially, maybe a couple of drinks on weekends.
25. 医師：On physical exam, your blood pressure and heart rate are quite elevated. Have you noticed when they tend to rise?
26. 患者：Not really, but during the episodes, it feels like my heart’s beating out of my chest.
27. 医師：What about headaches—do they feel like migraines or something different?
28. 患者：I don’t know. The pain is just really intense and throbbing, but it goes away after the episode ends.
29. 医師：Have you ever had a doctor investigate your blood pressure before these symptoms started?
30. 患者：No, I didn’t usually check it until these episodes started happening.
31. 医師：When you’ve measured your blood pressure, is it always this high, or does it vary?
32. 患者：It’s always been on the higher side when I check it.
33. 医師：Do you ever wake up at night because of these episodes?
34. 患者：No, they usually happen during the day.
35. 医師：Let me ask about your sweating—does it feel excessive, or are you soaking through your clothes?
36. 患者：Yeah, it feels excessive. I end up pretty drenched during the episodes.
37. 医師：Do you remember the first time you had one of these attacks? Was it during a stressful situation?
38. 患者：Not really. I think I was just sitting at home relaxing. That’s why it scared me.
39. 医師：I can imagine that must be unsettling. Do you happen to monitor your heart rate during these episodes?
40. 患者：I’ve checked it a couple of times, and it’s always really fast, over 100.
41. 医師：How’s your sleep? Do you ever wake up sweating or with a fast heart rate?
42. 患者：No, my sleep is usually okay. The symptoms haven’t woken me up.
43. 医師：Have you had any recent illnesses or injuries before these symptoms began?
44. 患者：No, nothing serious. I didn’t feel unwell before this started.
45. 医師：Your test results show elevated plasma-free metanephrines and catecholamines, which can explain these symptoms. We also found an adrenal mass on imaging studies, which suggests a possible pheochromocytoma.
46. 患者：What’s a pheochromocytoma?
47. 医師：It’s a type of tumor in the adrenal gland that causes excessive production of hormones like adrenaline, leading to symptoms like you’ve described—palpitations, sweating, high blood pressure, and headaches.
48. 患者：Is it serious? Can it be treated?
49. 医師：Yes, it can be treated. The first step is managing your blood pressure and heart rate with specific medications, followed by surgery to remove the tumor.
50. 患者：Okay, I’m glad there’s a plan. Thank you for explaining everything."
