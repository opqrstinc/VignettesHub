"1. 医師：Hello, I’m Dr. Smith. What brings you in today?  
2. 患者：Hi, doctor. I've been having a sore throat, neck pain, and swelling in the front of my neck for the past two weeks.  
3. 医師：I see. Has the neck swelling been getting worse over time?  
4. 患者：Yes, it seems to have gotten a bit bigger, and it feels more tender too.  
5. 医師：Do you feel the pain all the time, or is it worse with certain activities?  
6. 患者：It’s there all the time, but swallowing makes it worse.  
7. 医師：Have you had any fever, chills, or night sweats?  
8. 患者：I’ve had a mild fever on and off, but no chills or night sweats.  
9. 医師：Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?  
10. 患者：No, my weight has stayed about the same.  
11. 医師：What about your energy levels? Do you feel more tired than usual?  
12. 患者：Yes, actually. I’ve been really fatigued lately.  
13. 医師：Any rapid heartbeats, palpitations, or shaking in your hands?  
14. 患者：Not really palpitations, but I sometimes feel warm for no reason.  
15. 医師：When did the symptoms first begin?  
16. 患者：Around two weeks ago. It started with some throat discomfort, and then the swelling appeared.  
17. 医師：Did you have a cold or any upper respiratory infection before this started?  
18. 患者：No, I didn’t have any colds or anything like that.  
19. 医師：Have you had any injuries or trauma to your neck recently?  
20. 患者：No, nothing like that.  
21. 医師：Do you recall being exposed to any chemicals or toxic substances?  
22. 患者：No, not that I know of.  
23. 医師：Have you experienced this kind of issue with your throat or neck in the past?  
24. 患者：No, this is the first time.  
25. 医師：Do you have any other medical problems or take any medications regularly?  
26. 患者：No, I’m generally healthy and don’t take any medications.  
27. 医師：How about allergies, do you have any known allergies?  
28. 患者：Nope, no allergies.  
29. 医師：Does anyone in your family have thyroid problems?  
30. 患者：Not that I’m aware of.  
31. 医師：When you say the swelling is tender, is it painful to touch?  
32. 患者：Yes, it hurts when I press on it or when I move my neck.  
33. 医師：Have you noticed any changes in your voice, like hoarseness?  
34. 患者：No, my voice has been normal.  
35. 医師：What about difficulty breathing or swallowing food and liquids?  
36. 患者：Swallowing is uncomfortable, but no problems breathing or getting food down.  
37. 医師：Have you been feeling anxious or more irritable lately?  
38. 患者：Not really, just very tired.  
39. 医師：Have you noticed any swelling in other areas, like your underarms or behind your ears?  
40. 患者：No swelling anywhere else, just in the front of my neck.  
41. 医師：Do you feel any lumps or nodules in the swollen area?  
42. 患者：No, it just feels swollen all over and tender.  
43. 医師：What about difficulty tolerating heat or sweating excessively?  
44. 患者：Not really sweating, just that warm feeling more often.  
45. 医師：Have you been sleeping okay, or is your sleep disturbed by your symptoms?  
46. 患者：I’ve been sleeping okay, maybe just a little restless from the soreness.  
47. 医師：Do you drink alcohol or smoke?  
48. 患者：No, I don’t smoke, and I drink socially, maybe once or twice a month.  
49. 医師：Alright, based on what you’ve told me and the findings I see on your physical exam, I think we’re dealing with something involving your thyroid.  
50. 患者：Oh, I see. What could it be?  
51. 医師：It seems to be a condition called subacute thyroiditis. Your symptoms, the tenderness of the gland, and some specific test findings strongly suggest it."
