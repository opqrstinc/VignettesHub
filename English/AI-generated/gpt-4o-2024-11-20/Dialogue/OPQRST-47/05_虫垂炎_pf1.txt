33. Physician: I noticed some tenderness there. Does it hurt more when I release the pressure?  
34. Patient: Yes, it hurts even more when you let go.

49. Physician: It’s inflammation of the appendix, a small organ in the lower right side of your abdomen. It’s treatable, so don’t worry.  
50. Patient: Okay, I hope we can resolve this quickly.  "
