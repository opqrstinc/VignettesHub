2. 患者: I've been feeling unwell for a while now. Mainly headaches and feeling really down.  
3. 医師: I’m sorry to hear that. How long has this been going on?  
4. 患者: About three months. It’s been getting worse.  
5. 医師: Can you describe your headaches? Where do they hurt, and how severe are they?  
6. 患者: It’s like a dull ache around my temples. It’s not sharp, but it’s constant.  
7. 医師: Do you notice anything that makes it better or worse?  
8. 患者: Sometimes resting helps a bit, but nothing really makes it go away completely.  
9. 医師: Have you experienced nausea or other symptoms along with the headaches?  
10. 患者: Yes, I’ve been feeling nauseous quite a lot, but I haven’t actually vomited.  
11. 医師: Are there any specific triggers for your nausea?  
12. 患者: Not really. It just comes and goes.  
13. 医師: How about your appetite? Have you noticed any changes?  
14. 患者: I haven’t felt much like eating, actually. I’ve lost some weight too.

19. 医師: Do you have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep?  
20. 患者: No, I fall asleep okay, but I wake up way too early every day.  
21. 医師: Have you been feeling particularly stressed or upset recently?  
22. 患者: Not really. Nothing major has happened in my life lately.  
23. 医師: How has your mood been overall?

25. 医師: Has this affected your daily activities or relationships?  
26. 患者: Yes, I struggle to do even simple tasks, and I’ve lost interest in things I used to enjoy.  
27. 医師: Can you give some examples of these activities?  
28. 患者: I used to enjoy gardening and watching football, but now I don’t feel like doing either.  
29. 医師: Is there anything specific you’re worried about right now?  
30. 患者: Not really, I just wish I could feel like myself again.  
31. 医師: Have you had similar feelings or episodes like this in the past?

43. 医師: Have you ever felt like life is not worth living or had thoughts of harming yourself?  
44. 患者: No, I haven’t thought about harming myself, but I do feel hopeless at times.  
45. 医師: Thank you for sharing that. Have you tried anything to feel better, like hobbies or talking to someone?  
46. 患者: I’ve tried forcing myself to do things I used to like, but it doesn’t help.  
47. 医師: Are you on any medications or supplements currently?  
48. 患者: Just medication for my cholesterol.
