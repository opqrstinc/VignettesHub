"1. Physician: Hello, I’m Dr. Smith. What brings you in today?  
2. Patient: Hi, I’ve been having this really bad headache for the past two days.  
3. Physician: I’m sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about the headache? Where is the pain located?  
4. Patient: It’s on the left side of my head, and it’s really throbbing and severe.  
5. Physician: Has the headache been constant, or does it come and go?  
6. Patient: It’s been pretty constant over the last two days.  
7. Physician: Does anything make it worse?  
8. Patient: Physical activity, like walking, makes it so much worse.  
9. Physician: Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the headache?  
10. Patient: Yes, I feel very nauseous and even threw up once. The light and noise are unbearable too.  
11. Physician: That does sound uncomfortable. Have you had similar headaches before?  
12. Patient: Yes, I get headaches like this two or three times a month over the past two years.  
13. Physician: That’s quite frequent. Do you remember anything that might have triggered them?  
14. Patient: Not really, but I do spend a lot of time studying and on my computer.  
15. Physician: Has stress or lack of sleep ever seemed to bring on these headaches?  
16. Patient: Stress, maybe, but my sleep patterns are usually fine.  
17. Physician: Have you noticed anything you eat or drink that might bring them on?  
18. Patient: I’ve wondered if caffeine could be involved, but I’m not sure.  
19. Physician: Have you experienced any warning signs before these headaches, like seeing flashes of light or having numbness in your limbs?  
20. Patient: No, nothing like that.  
21. Physician: Okay, do you recall having a fever or recent illness before these headaches started?  
22. Patient: No, I haven’t been sick recently.  
23. Physician: Have you had any head injuries or trauma recently?  
24. Patient: No, not at all.  
25. Physician: How about medications — have you started or stopped any medications recently?  
26. Patient: I just use ibuprofen or acetaminophen sometimes, but they don’t help much.  
27. Physician: I see. When you take over-the-counter painkillers, do they provide any relief?  
28. Patient: Not really, they don’t do much for this kind of headache.  
29. Physician: Have these headaches affected your daily life significantly?  
30. Patient: Yes, they make it really hard to study and get my work done.  
31. Physician: That’s tough. Do you remember the first time you experienced these headaches?  
32. Patient: I think it started a couple of years ago, but I just lived with it.  
33. Physician: Do you have any medical conditions or family history of headaches or migraines?  
34. Patient: No medical conditions for me, but my mom has migraines.  
35. Physician: Family history can sometimes be a factor with migraines. How about your general health otherwise?  
36. Patient: I’m healthy otherwise, no big issues.  
37. Physician: Have you ever sought treatment for these headaches before?  
38. Patient: No, this is the first time.  
39. Physician: Okay. I’m going to ask some questions to rule out a few other causes. Have you had any weakness or numbness in your body?  
40. Patient: No, I’ve never had that.  
41. Physician: Any trouble with speech or vision beyond sensitivity to light?  
42. Patient: No, my vision and speech are fine.  
43. Physician: How about dizziness or balance problems?  
44. Patient: No dizziness, but I do feel tired when I get these headaches.  
45. Physician: That’s understandable with the symptoms you’ve described. Have you felt like fevers or chills accompanied these headaches?  
46. Patient: No, none of that.  
47. Physician: You mentioned nausea earlier—does it seem to happen every time you have these headaches?  
48. Patient: Yeah, it’s there every time, along with vomiting sometimes.  
49. Physician: Thank you for sharing all of this. Based on what you’ve told me and the absence of red flags in your symptoms or history, these headaches are consistent with migraines.  
50. Patient: Oh, migraines? That makes sense. So, what can I do to make them better?"
