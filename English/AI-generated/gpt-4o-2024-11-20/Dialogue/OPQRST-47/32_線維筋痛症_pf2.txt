4. Patient: It's a deep, aching pain that just never seems to go away.  
5. Physician: Is the pain in specific areas or more general?  
6. Patient: It's all over, but it feels worse in certain places like my shoulders, neck, and elbows.  
7. Physician: When did your symptoms first start?  
8. Patient: About six months ago, I noticed some mild aches here and there, but over time it became constant and much worse.  
9. Physician: Have you noticed anything that makes the pain better or worse?

12. Patient: I’m always exhausted, no matter how much I rest.  
13. Physician: Do you feel refreshed after sleeping?

16. Patient: Yes, I find it really hard to focus, and I forget things more often than I used to.  
17. Physician: Has this affected your daily activities or work?  
18. Patient: Absolutely. It’s hard to work or even do simple chores.  
19. Physician: Do you have any history of similar symptoms in the past?  
20. Patient: No, this is the first time I’ve experienced anything like this.  
21. Physician: Have you been feeling anxious or depressed?

36. Patient: I saw a general doctor who ran some blood tests, but nothing showed up.  
37. Physician: What about over-the-counter pain medication? Has it helped at all?

39. Physician: Has anyone in your family experienced similar symptoms?  
40. Patient: Not that I know of.

49. Physician: Based on what you’ve told me, I think this might be fibromyalgia. Does that term sound familiar to you?
