"1. 医師：Hello, can you tell me what brings you in today?  
2. 患者：I’ve been experiencing episodes of dizziness and sweating that started about four months ago.  
3. 医師：Can you describe what happens during these episodes?  
4. 患者：Sure, they just come on suddenly. I feel dizzy, start sweating a lot, and my heart races.  
5. 医師：Do you notice any specific triggers for these episodes?  
6. 患者：No, that’s the thing—they seem to happen out of nowhere.  
7. 医師：How often do these episodes occur?  
8. 患者：Maybe two or three times a week.  
9. 医師：How long do the episodes usually last?  
10. 患者：Around 10 to 20 minutes, but it feels much longer when it’s happening.  
11. 医師：Do you feel anything else besides dizziness and sweating during these episodes?  
12. 患者：Yes, I feel like I can’t breathe, and there’s this chest tightness.  
13. 医師：Have you ever felt like your life was in danger during one of these episodes?  
14. 患者：Yes, I get this overwhelming sense of doom like something terrible is about to happen.  
15. 医師：Have the symptoms affected your daily life in any way?  
16. 患者：Definitely. I’ve missed a lot of school and stopped hanging out with my friends.  
17. 医師：Do the episodes ever occur in specific places or situations?  
18. 患者：No, they’re completely random. I could be at home or outside; it doesn’t matter.  
19. 医師：Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?  
20. 患者：No, I don’t use any substances like that.  
21. 医師：Have you had any significant stress or changes in your life recently?  
22. 患者：Not really. My life has been pretty normal, except for these episodes.  
23. 医師：Do you have any medical conditions or take any medications regularly?  
24. 患者：No, I’ve always been healthy and I don’t take any medicines.  
25. 医師：Is there a family history of medical conditions like heart problems or anxiety?  
26. 患者：No, my family doesn’t have any major health issues.  
27. 医師：How would you describe your mood generally?  
28. 患者：I’ve been pretty anxious, especially about when the next episode will happen.  
29. 医師：Do you have trouble sleeping or concentrating?  
30. 患者：Sometimes, yes. I keep worrying, and it’s hard to focus on anything.  
31. 医師：Do you have any physical symptoms outside these episodes, like weight changes?  
32. 患者：No, I haven’t noticed anything like that.  
33. 医師：During the episodes, do you ever feel like you’re losing control or disconnected?  
34. 患者：Yes, it’s like I’m not even in my body sometimes.  
35. 医師：Have you tried anything to stop or reduce the episodes?  
36. 患者：I’ve tried deep breathing, but it doesn’t really help much.  
37. 医師：Do the episodes ever wake you up from sleep, or do they only happen when you’re awake?  
38. 患者：They only happen when I’m awake.  
39. 医師：Have you had any chest pains or fainting spells outside these episodes?  
40. 患者：No, just during the episodes.  
41. 医師：We’ll run some tests to make sure there’s no underlying physical condition. Are you okay with that?  
42. 患者：Yes, absolutely. I just want this to stop.  
43. 医師：Physical exams and tests show everything is normal. Your heart, thyroid, and general health seem fine.  
44. 患者：That’s a relief, but it’s still frustrating because I don’t know what’s wrong.  
45. 医師：Your symptoms and test results suggest you might have something called panic disorder.  
46. 患者：Panic disorder? What does that mean?  
47. 医師：It’s a condition where people experience frequent, unexpected panic attacks, like the episodes you described.  
48. 患者：Is it serious?  
49. 医師：It’s not life-threatening, but it can disrupt daily life. The good news is it’s treatable.  
50. 患者：Thank you. I’m ready to do what’s needed to get better.  "
