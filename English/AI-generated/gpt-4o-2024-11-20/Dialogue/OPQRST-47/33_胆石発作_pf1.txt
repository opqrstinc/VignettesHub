29.  
Doctor: Has any doctor mentioned gallstones to you before?

Patient: It’s about the same, still very painful.  
42.  
Doctor: Were you able to walk in here okay, or did someone help you?

49.  
Doctor: Does your job involve heavy lifting or significant physical activity?  
Patient: No, I have a desk job.  
50.  
Doctor: Based on everything we’ve discussed, I suspect you might have an issue with your gallbladder, possibly an infection or stones causing blockage. We'll need some imaging and lab tests to confirm—let’s get started.
