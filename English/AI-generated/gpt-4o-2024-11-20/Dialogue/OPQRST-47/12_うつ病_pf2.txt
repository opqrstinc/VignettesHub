"1. 医師：Hello, how can I assist you today?  
2. 患者：I’ve been feeling extremely tired and just not hungry for about six months now.  
3. 医師：I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me a bit more about how these symptoms started and how they've changed?  
4. 患者：It started gradually, but the tiredness has gotten worse. I feel like I can hardly get through my daily tasks or focus at work anymore.  
5. 医師：That sounds difficult. Do you feel tired all the time, or are there parts of the day when it’s better or worse?  
6. 患者：It’s worse in the mornings. I wake up feeling exhausted and just… heavy.  
7. 医師：How’s your mood been during this time?  
8. 患者：Not great. I feel down most days, like there’s no real point to anything I’m doing.  
9. 医師：I see. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep?  
10. 患者：Yes, I’ve been having trouble falling asleep, and when I do sleep, I wake up a lot during the night or really early in the morning.  
11. 医師：That must make the fatigue even harder to deal with. Have you experienced any changes in your weight over this time?  
12. 患者：No, my weight hasn’t really changed, but I’m barely eating. I just don’t feel hungry.  
13. 医師：Have you had any specific situations or events that triggered these feelings?  
14. 患者：I can’t think of anything specific, but I’ve been missing a lot of work and avoiding friends because I feel so low and...lonely.  
15. 医師：That’s a tough position to be in. Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or ending your life?  
16. 患者：No, not really. I feel hopeless sometimes, but nothing like that.  
17. 医師：Thank you for sharing that. Have you had any medical issues in the past that you think might relate to this?  
18. 患者：I’ve had IBS for years, but it hasn’t really been acting up lately.  
19. 医師：How about your energy levels—have you noticed weakness or difficulty even doing small tasks?  
20. 患者：Yes, even small things like washing the dishes feel like they're too much sometimes.  
21. 医師：I understand. Have you noticed any trouble thinking or focusing?  
22. 患者：Yes, it’s really hard to concentrate. I feel like my brain is just sluggish all the time.  
23. 医師：What about your emotions—do you often feel guilt or worthlessness during the day?  
24. 患者：Yes, I feel like I’m failing at everything, and I don’t even know why.  
25. 医師：Do you have any particular hobbies or things you used to enjoy? Are you still doing them?  
26. 患者：I used to like painting, but I haven’t done it in months. I don’t have the energy or interest anymore.  
27. 医師：Have you had any recent illnesses or infections in the last six months?  
28. 患者：No, I can’t think of any.  
29. 医師：Any history of using substances like alcohol, drugs, or any medications regularly?  
30. 患者：No, I don’t drink or use drugs.  
31. 医師：What about your family or social life—are you feeling supported by those around you?  
32. 患者：I don’t think so. I’ve been withdrawing from everyone lately, and I think they don’t understand what’s wrong with me.  
33. 医師：Thank you for telling me that. Can I ask if you’ve ever felt this way before at any other point in your life?  
34. 患者：No, nothing like this.  
35. 医師：Do you feel like these symptoms are affecting your ability to work or maintain your relationships?  
36. 患者：Definitely. I’m falling behind at my job, and my partner and I have been arguing a lot because I’ve been so withdrawn.  
37. 医師：What about physical symptoms like body aches, headaches, or anything unusual that you’ve noticed?  
38. 患者：Not really. Just the fatigue and the lack of sleep.  
39. 医師：Would you describe yourself as easily stressed or overwhelmed during this time?  
40. 患者：Yes, very much so. Small things feel like they’re too much to handle.  
41. 医師：Have you noticed any moments of feeling better temporarily, or does it feel constant?  
42. 患者：It feels constant. I rarely have good days anymore.  
43. 医師：Do you recall feeling particularly stressed at work before these feelings started?  
44. 患者：Maybe a little, but nothing unusually stressful.  
45. 医師：You mentioned IBS earlier—have you had digestive issues or changes during this time?  
46. 患者：No changes, but I’m eating so little that my stomach doesn’t bother me much.  
47. 医師：Have you tried anything to help with how you’ve been feeling—rest, exercise, anything else?  
48. 患者：I’ve tried sleeping more, but I just can't seem to get good rest.  
49. 医師：I understand. Based on everything you’ve told me and some questionnaires we’ve reviewed, it seems that you may be experiencing something we call major depressive disorder.  
50. 患者：I was worried it might be something like that. What can we do about it?"
