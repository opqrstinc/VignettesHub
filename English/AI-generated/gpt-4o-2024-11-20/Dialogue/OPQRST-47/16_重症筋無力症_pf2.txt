13. 医師：Can you describe the weakness? Is it more in the arms, legs, or both?  
14. 患者：It’s in both. I have trouble lifting my arms and climbing stairs.  
15. 医師：Does the weakness get better with rest?  
16. 患者：Yes, I feel better after resting, but it comes back.  
17. 医師：Have you noticed droopy eyelids or any changes in your vision?

26. 患者：I have diabetes, but it’s been controlled with my medications.  
27. 医師：What medication are you taking for diabetes?  
28. 患者：I’m on metformin, 500 mg, twice a day.  
29. 医師：Any family history of muscle problems or autoimmune diseases?  
30. 患者：Not that I know of.  
31. 医師：Are there any activities that make your symptoms worse?  
32. 患者：Yes, anything physical, like exercising or even carrying groceries.  
33. 医師：And do you feel your symptoms are getting progressively worse?  
34. 患者：Yes, they’ve been slowly worsening over the past few months.  
35. 医師：Are you able to work or perform daily activities like before?  
36. 患者：No, I’ve been struggling to keep up with my job and housework.  
37. 医師：How are you feeling emotionally? These symptoms must be quite challenging.  
38. 患者：It’s been really frustrating and stressful not knowing what’s wrong.  
39. 医師：We’ll do our best to figure this out. Have you had any difficulty breathing?  
40. 患者：Not really, but sometimes it feels hard to take a deep breath.  
41. 医師：I noticed your eyelids seem droopy. Does it get worse throughout the day?  
42. 患者：Yes, it starts off okay in the morning and gets worse by evening.  
43. 医師：Have you ever had any surgeries or significant illnesses in the past?

48. 患者：No, my sensation seems normal.  
49. 医師：Do your symptoms ever fluctuate day to day, or are they mostly constant?  
50. 患者：They seem worse later in the day or after doing something tiring.  
51. 医師：Based on what you’ve shared and our findings, I suspect you may have myasthenia gravis, a condition that affects the communication between your nerves and muscles.  
52. 患者：Myasthenia gravis? What is it?  
53. 医師：It’s an autoimmune condition where your immune system produces antibodies that interfere with the signals from nerves to muscles, causing weakness.  
54. 患者：Is it treatable?  
55. 医師：Yes, there are medications like pyridostigmine and sometimes steroids that can help improve muscle strength. We’ll also check for any underlying involvement, like a thymoma.  
56. 患者：What’s a thymoma?  
57. 医師：It’s a growth in the thymus gland that can sometimes trigger myasthenia gravis. We’ll do imaging to check for it.  
58. 患者：Okay. What’s the plan now?  
59. 医師：We’ll order some tests to confirm the diagnosis and check for antibodies related to this condition. Once we have more information, we’ll start the appropriate treatment.  
60. 患者：Thank you, doctor. I just want to feel better."
