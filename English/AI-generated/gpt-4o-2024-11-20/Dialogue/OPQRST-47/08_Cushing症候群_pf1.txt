4. Patient: About eight months ago.  
5. Physician: Have you experienced any changes in your strength or ability to do daily activities?  
6. Patient: Yes, my muscles feel weaker, especially in my arms and legs. It's hard to climb stairs or lift things.  
7. Physician: Do you have any other unusual symptoms, such as changes in your skin?  
8. Patient: I bruise easily, and I noticed these purple marks on my stomach.  
9. Physician: Can you describe these marks more specifically?  
10. Patient: They’re wide, purplish lines across my belly.  
11. Physician: Do you recall any recent injuries that might explain the bruising?  
12. Patient: No, I don't remember hitting myself recently.  
13. Physician: Has your medical history changed recently? Any new diagnoses, medications, or lifestyle changes?  
14. Patient: No, everything has been the same.

16. Patient: Pretty well. I take my medications regularly.  
17. Physician: Have you noticed changes in your blood sugar or blood pressure lately?

19. Physician: Do you have any problems with your sleep, such as changes in your sleep-wake routine?  
20. Patient: I’ve been feeling more tired, but I don’t think my sleep habits have changed much.  
21. Physician: Does anyone in your family have similar symptoms or an endocrine condition?  
22. Patient: No, my family is healthy as far as I know.  
23. Physician: Have you experienced headaches or any vision changes recently?  
24. Patient: No, nothing like that.  
25. Physician: How about feelings of anxiety, depression, or mood swings?  
26. Patient: I’ve been feeling more stressed lately, but I don’t know if it’s related.  
27. Physician: Have you had any issues with excessive hair growth or acne?  
28. Patient: No, nothing like that.  
29. Physician: Are you noticing any changes in muscle or joint pain?  
30. Patient: Just the weakness in my muscles, no joint pain.  
31. Physician: Tell me more about your daily activities. Do you work?  
32. Patient: Yes, I work in an office, mostly at a desk.  
33. Physician: Do you exercise or maintain a specific diet?  
34. Patient: Not much exercise recently because of my weakness, and I try to eat healthy.  
35. Physician: Have you ever used any supplements, steroids, or other medications recently?  
36. Patient: No, none at all.  
37. Physician: Do you notice swelling in your legs or difficulty breathing?  
38. Patient: No, I've not had those issues.  
39. Physician: Do you feel like your symptoms worsen at a specific time during the day?  
40. Patient: Not that I’ve noticed.

42. Patient: Yes, I’ve noticed more fat around the back of my neck.

44. Patient: I sweat more easily now, even without much activity.  
45. Physician: Have you ever experienced abdominal pain or noticed any changes in your bowel habits?  
46. Patient: No abdominal pain or changes, just the stretch marks.  
47. Physician: We’re going to run some tests, but based on your symptoms, I suspect this could be related to a hormonal imbalance.  
48. Patient: A hormonal imbalance? That makes sense, I guess.  
49. Physician: Your symptoms, like weight gain, muscle weakness, round face, and purple marks, suggest something like Cushing syndrome, which involves excess cortisol.  
50. Patient: I see. What happens next?"
